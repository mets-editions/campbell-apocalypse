        <p>The Middle English Texts Series offers a diverse and representative array of literary
          texts that medieval readers in the present-day British Isles would have encountered
          between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries. It is committed to making available both
          affordable print and open access editions to scholars, teachers, and students of the
          Western Middle Ages. In its digital publications, the series prioritizes a user-friendly
          interface and viewing options, multiple downloadable formats, enhanced searchability and
          filtering, and accessibility to the widest possible range of users.</p>
      </projectDesc>
      <editorialDecl>
        <p>METS takes as its mission the creation of affordable editions that would pass scrutiny
          from the most demanding expert, yet would prove comprehensible, and even enticing, to
          someone who had never read Middle English before. This agenda dictates that METS
          publications offer not a critical edition reflecting all surviving manuscripts, and
          certainly not a diplomatic edition, but a best-text edition, informed by the notes and
          apparatus of earlier editions (where these exist), and by substantive variants from other
          manuscript witnesses. Transcriptions of Middle English texts are lightly modernized to
          ensure a smooth reading experience, while non-English texts preserve both the original
          language and a modern English translation in facing-page format. Each edition offers
          expert assistance with language and lexicon, providing glosses alongside the text(s),
          textual and explanatory notes, elucidation of unfamiliar contexts and traditions, and
          thematic and interpretive possibilities. All editions feature general introductions that
          set the edited text within its own time, place, and traditions, and link it to ancestor,
          congener, and successor materials. All publications contain comprehensive, current
          bibliographies of pertinent scholarship and criticism. House style is adapted from the <hi
            rend="italic">Chicago Manual of Style</hi>.</p>
        <correction>
          <p>This text may include corrections made after the original edition went to press in
            order to correct errors and improve glosses. For a full list of editorial and

          in the early Christian church, is the named author of thirteen books in the New Testament,
          including the Second Epistle to Timothy, which is quoted here. Though modern scholarship
          disputes Paul’s authorship of the Epistles to Timothy, it was unquestioned in religious
          writing of the fourteenth century.</note>

          mistranslations, and the source of the error can be found with reasonable certainty by
          comparing alternatives from AN and Middle English, and from the Vulgate if applicable (for
          example, see notes for 5.¶3 and 21.¶7, below). In other cases, the English translator
          deliberately revises or makes additions, for reasons that may or may not be clear (see
          notes for 13.¶9, <hi rend="italic">noon schal han power</hi> and <hi rend="italic">that
            is</hi><hi rend="italic"> to seie</hi>, and 20.¶3 below). In still other cases, such as
          this one, the appearance of an independent phrase is simply a mystery. It appears to be
          either a mistranslation or a revision of the AN <hi rend="italic">en sa </hi><hi

          H uses <hi rend="italic">assailen</hi> [assail], and clearly the same meaning is intended

          it does describe two types of <hi rend="italic">goostly</hi> or spiritual visions
          (sleeping and waking) and another type of sight called <hi rend="italic">intellectus</hi>,
          a spiritual understanding within the soul, given by God through revelation.</note>

          spiritual sight — Pharaoh, who saw dream visions in his sleep (Genesis 41:1–38) and Moses,
          who saw a vision while awake (Exodus 3:1–6) — and one biblical example of “intellectual”
          sight in the Apostle Paul, who ascended to heaven spiritually and saw the secrets of God
          with his “spiritual eye” (2 Corinthians 12:2–4). The vision of John in the Apocalypse, the
          prologue says, is an example of this latter category of intellectual sight, since John
          both saw visions and understood what they meant.</note>

          one of several traditional interpretations for their identity — they are “the seven giftis
          of the Holi Goost” as listed in Isaias 11:2–3 (see note for 5.¶4, <hi rend="italic">the

          authority), and mercy. They are not to be confused with the seven “gifts of the Spirit”

          though the gloss accompanying it was complete. Alternatively, the scribe may simply have

          corresponding changes in the gloss. See also notes for 2.¶6, 4.¶4, <hi rend="italic">Bi

          of the Vulgate <hi rend="italic">angeli</hi> [angels] and LV <hi rend="italic"
            >aungelis</hi>. It is the first example of a translation decision that will run
          throughout chapter 2 of the AN and <hi rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi> — referring
          to the angels of the seven churches in Asia Minor, to whom the Apostle John is tasked to
          bring messages, as prelates or bishops (see notes for <hi rend="italic">bischop</hi> in
          2.¶¶1, 5, 7, and 11, below). The Plimpton manuscript begins to follow the Vulgate in using
            <hi rend="italic">aungele</hi> starting in 3:1, but P continues to use <hi rend="italic"
            >bisschop</hi> or simply <hi rend="italic">the chirche</hi> throughout chapter 3 as well
          (see textual notes for <hi rend="italic">And to </hi><hi rend="italic">the aungele</hi> in
          3.¶¶1, 4–5, and 7–9). These are not mistranslations; they represent rather a decision to
          incorporate an interpretation of the text into the text itself at the expense of literal
          meaning. The interpretation in question is not an unusual or controversial one — clearly
          the intended audience for John’s messages to the churches is not angels but the leaders of
          those churches. St. Jerome makes this point in his prologue to the Apocalypse, which
          appears in translation at the start of the Wycliffite LV: <hi rend="italic">Joon writeth
            to sevene chirchis of Asye and to her </hi><hi rend="italic">sevene bysshops of the
            forseide thingis</hi> (Pro.¶7). The LV, however, stays faithful to the literal words in
          the Vulgate and does not incorporate this interpretation into its translation. The gloss
          commentary of the <hi rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi> also makes frequent reference
          to bishops and prelates and reflects on the qualities of a faithful church leader, for
          example in the gloss that follows this passage (1.¶11).</note>

          Given the generally anticlerical tone of the gloss (see multiple notes for 13.¶9 — <hi

          20.¶3, below), within a manuscript that contains Lollard material, it may be significant
          that the MS alters H’s reference here to church officials shriving congregants through the
          sacrament of penance (see textual note) — that is, hearing confession, prescribing works
          of satisfaction, and absolving from sin — and instead focuses solely on the priest’s duty
          to preach and <hi rend="italic">conseile men after Goddis lawe</hi>. Late fourteenth and
          early fifteenth-century Lollards tended to be suspicious of the priestly office in general
          and debated its necessity and role in performing sacraments like penance, especially if
          the priest in question had fallen into mortal sin. For example, John Wyclif argues in his
          late tract <hi rend="italic">De Blasphemia</hi> that “It is of no use, and is even
          hurtful, to confess to a simoniacal priest,” and recommends that if all available priests
          are sinful, the parishioner “ought then to prefer to confess to one of the faithful laity”
          (Wyclif, <hi rend="italic">De Blasphemia</hi>, ed. Dziewicki, pp. 117, 125). Later
          Lollards echo this argument, for example in conclusions 8 and 9 of the <hi rend="italic"
            >Thirty-Seven Conclusions</hi>, a public document defending their beliefs before the
          English Parliament in 1395 (Forshall, ed., <hi rend="italic">Remonstrance</hi>, pp.
          18–22). The gloss makes many other references to <hi rend="italic">schrift</hi> and <hi

            rend="italic">prelatis</hi> who <hi rend="italic">shryven hem</hi> is its most direct

          Elijah, and died by defenestration in fulfillment of a prophecy that she would be eaten by

          group, perhaps the authors of the prophetic books of the Hebrew Bible — in which case they

          the interpretation of lions as symbols for Christ, was commonplace in biblical
          commentaries by the fourteenth century. Its earliest iteration may be traced to the
          second-century Greek text <hi rend="italic">Physiologus</hi> (Curley, ed., pp. 3–4),
          translated into Latin in the fifth century, whose descriptions of the allegorical meanings

          regulations that follow in the books of Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. As
          the gloss illustrates here, Christian theologians viewed Christ’s death on the cross as a
          type of blood sacrifice that satisfied the requirements of the Old Law for Christian
          believers and instituted a New Law rooted in the teachings of Jesus.</note>

          and foretells that it will produce a line of kings. Jesus is also named here the “root of
          David” in reference to a prophecy in Isaias 11:1–10 that a messianic figure will arise
          from the “root of Jesse,” David’s father — in other words, from the lineage of King David.
          The Apostle Paul explicitly identifies this figure as Christ and calls him the “Root of

          speaks of Christian believers being redeemed not by silver or gold but by Christ’s blood;
          the Vulgate <hi rend="italic">redempti</hi> [redeemed] is translated by the Wycliffite LV

          for example in 1 Corinthians 6:20, <hi rend="italic">ye ben bought with greet pris</hi>
          (LV). But the general metaphor of sin as a financial debt that must be repaid to God or
          forgiven runs throughout the Bible, including the well-known phrase from the Lord’s
          Prayer, “Forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors” (Matthew 6:12; Luke 11:4), and
          the parables of Jesus that use debt as an analogy for sin (see Matthew 18:21–34; Luke

          gives two possible interpretations for the seven clasps (better known in modern English as
          the “seven seals”). The first possibility is that they are the seven sacraments of the
          church, the most important rituals of the Christian faith through which God extends grace
          to mankind — baptism, confirmation, the Eucharist (or Communion), penance (which includes
          confession, satisfaction, and absolution), extreme unction (or anointing), ordination, and
          marriage. The other potential interpretation the gloss provides for the seven clasps is
          that they are the seven “gifts of the Spirit” from Isaias 11:2–3 (see note for 5.¶4,
          below).</note>

          belief that lions swept away their own tracks with their tails to hide and slept with
          their eyes open can be traced to the second-century <hi rend="italic">Physiologus</hi>, in
          the same passage which claims that lion cubs are born dead for three days (see note for
          4.¶6, above). The gloss uses these traits to draw parallels between the lion and Christ,
          who hid his divine nature from “the proud” and was both dead in the flesh and alive in
          spirit at the same time after the Crucifixion. In a similar way, the <hi rend="italic"
            >Physiologus</hi> says that Christ, “the spiritual lion of the tribe of Judah . . . hid
          his intelligible tracks (that is, his divine nature), from the unbelieving Jews,” and that
          he “physically slept on the cross, but his divine nature always keeps watch in the right

          and is an apparent mistranslation of the AN <hi rend="italic">phioles</hi> (Fridner, p.
          40), from the Vulgate <hi rend="italic">phialas</hi> [vials]. LV translates the word as
            <hi rend="italic">viols</hi>, an alternate spelling of <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi
            rend="italic">fiole</hi> (n.), sense 1a, “A small glass or metal bowl or cup for
          liquids, incense, etc.” However, the Middle English <hi rend="italic">viol</hi> can also
          refer to a violin or fiddle (see <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic">viol</hi>
          [n.]), which might explain the translator’s confusion. Adding to the potential confusion
          with <hi rend="italic">phioles</hi> is the word’s pairing with a musical instrument — <hi
            rend="italic">harpes</hi> in AN, translated directly to Middle English as <hi
            rend="italic">harpis</hi> — though the phrase <hi rend="italic">ful of</hi><hi

            >phioles</hi>, unlike the harps, are objects that can be filled with perfume or incense.
          Only one later manuscript of the <hi rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi>, Bodley Laud
          Misc. 33, accurately translates the word as <hi rend="italic">fiolis</hi> [vials]
          (Fridner, p. 40). Since <hi rend="italic">fithelis</hi> is attested in the earliest

          11:2 lists seven “gifts of the Spirit,” which the Apocalypse commentary here notes were
          all possessed by Jesus; this passage in Isaias as a whole describes a figure traditionally
          interpreted by Christian theologians as Christ. The gloss here also supplies an identity
          for the <hi rend="italic">sevene spiritis</hi> around the throne of God, which first
          appeared in 1:4, and says they embody the seven gifts (see note for 1.¶2, above). The LV

          destruction: the sword (war), hunger (famine), death (translated “plague” or “pestilence”
          in modern editions), and the beasts of the earth. AN and LV follow suit. By dropping the
          conjunction — a mistranslation that appears in all manuscripts — the <hi rend="italic"
            >English Apocalypse</hi> appears to reduce the types of destruction to three, with “the

          and regards <hi rend="italic">deeth</hi> and <hi rend="italic">the bestes of the</hi><hi

          of the four riders, traditionally known as the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, carries a
          means of destruction, rather than the last rider carrying all four. For example, the King
          James Version of 1611 reads: “And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the

          be used to make a shroud, the awning of a boat, or an altar covering, any one of which
          fits the metaphor of the sun being covered or shaded. The gloss extends this metaphor
          further, with a reference to another common use for haircloth — as an uncomfortable
          garment or hairshirt, which could serve as an aid in penance (see sense 2). The
          apocalyptic tribulations that Jesus’s followers will undergo are like the “hard” or rough
          cloth of a penitential garment that will lead them to greater righteousness.</note>

          tribe of Ephraim was descended from a son of Joseph (see Genesis 41:51–52), replaces Dan
          in the list of twelve. The biblical text gives no explanation for the absence of either
          Dan or Ephraim, but the two tribes may be excluded because they led a rebellion which
          caused the kingdom of Israel to divide following King Solomon’s death, and their lands
          served as the locations of two golden idols which the northern half of the kingdom
          established in competition with the Temple at Jerusalem (3 Kings 12:25–30). The <hi

          than the AN and Vulgate in placing Manassah last in the list (see the textual note for

          wandered in the desert (Exodus 16:35), and the number of days Jesus spent fasting in the
          wilderness before starting his public ministry (Matthew 4:2; Mark 1:13; Luke 4:2). In the
          church calendar, the season of Lent, the period from Ash Wednesday to Easter which is
          associated with fasting and penance, is also forty days excluding Sundays. The number four
          is here associated with “the faith of the Gospels” because there are four Gospel accounts
          in the New Testament: the Books of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.</note>

          several tribulations will arise, such as the smoke and giant locusts in verses 2 and 3 and
          the Beast in 11:7 (11.¶6), and as the place where Satan will be imprisoned in 20:1–2

          with 1,260 days in the passage that immediately follows (see 11:3; 11.¶4). The gloss also

          by revealing their sin, both presumably figurative actions. “Closing” the menace of the

        <note type="enote" n="82"><space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">seven hed synnes</hi>.
          The gloss interprets the dragon’s seven heads as a series of tyrants who commit the Seven
          Deadly Sins (pride, greed, lust, envy, gluttony, wrath, and sloth), with a pun on <hi

          actions directly to two of the Deadly Sins, <hi rend="italic">coveitise</hi> [greed] and
            <hi rend="italic">lecherie</hi> [lust], with the former “maintaining” or supporting the
          latter. Commentaries on the Seven Deadly Sins frequently described the ways the various
          sins interacted with one another in this manner. For example, the Parson’s sermon in
          Chaucer’s <hi rend="italic">Canterbury Tales</hi> lists the fifth of the Deadly Sins as
          “Avarice and Coveitise” and quotes the Apostle Paul in 1 Timothy 6:10 saying “the roote of
          alle harmes is Coveitise” (<hi rend="italic">CT</hi> X[I].738). In its discourse on
          “Lecherie,” the seventh of the Deadly Sins, the Parson’s sermon draws a link similar to
          the gloss, describing the way the physical temptation of lust flows from the broader
          spiritual sin of greed: “for the coveitise of eyen [eyes] folweth the coveitise of the
          herte” (852).</note>

          The “children” that the gloss refers to here may be literal children or, with the
          reference to being <hi rend="italic">borun thurgh baptem</hi>, any members of the church
          who have experienced rebirth through the sacrament of baptism (see, for example, the
          imagery of baptism as rebirth in John 3:3–5 and Romans 6:3–4). The gloss clearly does not
          view baptism as an automatic protection from sin; in fact, it may even serve as an
          allurement for the devil, who wishes to lead Christians astray.</note>

          righteous people, who resist his temptations, set their hearts on spiritual things, act
          with meekness, and practice penance. The final example of righteous people thwarting the
          devil is the <hi rend="italic">old man and woman</hi> on their deathbeds who resist the

            rend="italic">than he hath beste tyme</hi> is not in the AN original, which notes simply
          that the devil tries to encumber people with sin when he knows his time is short (Fridner,
          p. 96). The meaning of <hi rend="italic">beste</hi> in this context is not fully clear —
          it might imply that the devil is more successful in these attacks because he is more
          vigorous, or it may mean that this near-death time is simply the most important or the
          most urgent, both for the devil and for the one resisting him.</note>

          variety of secondary meanings may be relevant, including to say, tell a story, write,
          disclose, announce, describe, preach, prophesy, report, argue, discern, and judge. The LV
            <hi rend="italic">acounte</hi>, which is closer to the AN <hi rend="italic">acunte</hi>,

          a forbidden fruit by casting doubt on the truthfulness of God’s words (Genesis 3:1–7). The

          Pentecost in the Book of Acts, in which the Holy Spirit descends like tongues of fire onto
          Jesus’s followers and allows them to speak in other languages (Acts 2:1–4). It is unclear
          why the gloss describes this event as occurring <hi rend="italic">priveli</hi> [secretly],
          since the Pentecost scene is a very public one involving people from all nations (2:5–13),
          and it concludes with a public sermon from Peter to thousands of people (2:14–41).
          However, in the chapter before this scene, Jesus privately promises the disciples he will
          send the Holy Spirit (Acts 1:4–5), and in the Gospel of John, Jesus bestows the Holy
          Spirit on his disciples while they are hiding in a locked room, though it appears as a
          breath rather than fire (John 20:22). The gloss draws a contrast between these
          manifestations of the Holy Spirit, meant to instill faith in Christian believers, and the
          public spectacle of the Antichrist raining fire onto the earth and performing other
          miracles for the purpose of deception and power.</note>

          which is not in H or in the AN original (see textual note), in order to focus the critique
          on church officials who earn money from “lands and rents,” a highly contentious issue in
          the fourteenth century especially among monastic orders, whose members were not
          technically allowed to own property but could do so through the legal loophole of communal
          ownership. John Wyclif and his Lollard followers came to believe that monastic orders,
          whom they called “possessioners,” and any church officials whose wealth came from land
          ownership, should be dispossessed by the government if they fell into mortal sin. Wyclif
          argues that this condition describes the entire contemporary church, which warrants
          forcing all clergy to return to a state of poverty (see Wyclif, <hi rend="italic">De
            Civili Dominio</hi>, ed. Loserth, 3:49–60). The poet William Langland echoes the

          passage, which is an English interpolation not found in the AN original, expresses
          traditional concerns about corrupt priests and other “prelates” or church officials who
          have become wealthy through simony, the selling of ecclesiastical offices for money, so
          named for Simon the Magician in Acts 8:9–24, who attempts to purchase the power of the
          Holy Spirit from the Apostle Peter. The passage also expresses a common anticlerical
          suspicion that young men <hi rend="italic">go to the ordre</hi>, a reference to the
          priesthood and also possibly religious orders of monks and friars, for the purpose of
          satisfying the <hi rend="italic">bodili delites</hi> of gluttony and lust. For example, a
          late fourteenth-century Lollard sermon entitled “On the Leaven of the Pharisees,” after
          listing several of the sexual sins priests and friars engage in, complains that young men
          are attracted to these orders and their hypocritical vows of celibacy for this very
          reason: “It semeth the devyl gedreth [gathers] siche lumpis of yonge men, fatte and
          lykynge [healthy, amorous] and ydyl, and byndith hem fro wyves” (Matthew, ed., <hi
            rend="italic">English Works</hi>, pp. 6–7). Linking priests, members of religious
          orders, and popes with the Antichrist is also a hallmark of John Wyclif’s writings and
          sermons starting in the 1370s, and a theme taken up vigorously by his followers in the
          Lollard movement. For example, the early fifteenth-century Lollard tract <hi rend="italic"
            >The Lanterne of Light</hi> (Dean, ed. <hi rend="italic">Medieval English Political
            Writings</hi>) describes Antichrist metaphorically as a serpent, with the pope at its
          head and other church officials making up its body and tail: “in the court of Rome is the
          heed of Anticrist and in archebischopis and bischopis is the bodi of Anticrist. But in
          thise cloutid [rag-tag] sectis, as mounkis, chanouns, and freris [friars] is the venymous
          taile of Anticrist” (lines 319–22). In a commentary on Revelation 16, the tract also
          includes “the pseudo-prophete or fals prechour” as part of Antichrist’s tail (lines
          399–400). As the <hi rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi> demonstrates, this anticlerical
          strain in English religious writing predates Wyclif and his followers, but it may help to
          explain why the compiler of the Plimpton manuscript, which contains Lollard material in
          addition to the Wycliffite New Testament, was drawn to this version of the Apocalypse in
          the first place.</note>

          numerals, DCLXVI, and arranging them to form the Latin phrase <hi rend="italic">dic
            lux</hi>, “to say light” which the gloss takes to mean “so-called light” or “alleged
          light.” The beast’s number thus represents the Antichrist, whose false light contrasts
          with the true light of Christ.</note>

          of Israel, the destruction of Jerusalem, and the Israelites who went into exile in the
          city of Babylon under the rule of King Nebuchadnezzar (4 Kings 25:1–12). The Book of
          Daniel, among others, also recounts the fall of Babylon a generation later (Daniel
          5:1–31). By the time of the New Testament, Babylon had not existed for more than 500
          years, but it appears in the Apocalypse as both a general figure of decadence and decay,
          represented as a prostitute and contrasted with the city of New Jerusalem that descends
          from heaven in 21:2 (21.¶1), and as a specific metaphor for Rome, whose fall is
          prophetically predicted throughout the Apocalypse. See, for example, verses 16:19
          (16.¶12), 17:16–18 (17.¶8), and 18:2 (18.¶1).</note>

          consistent in using <hi rend="italic">his</hi> to refer to Babylon, the city which is
          represented throughout the Apocalypse as an immoral woman, but also occasionally uses
          plural pronouns. MS consistently uses feminine pronouns for Babylon in the biblical text

          apparently added by the Middle English translator working from the Vulgate. The Vulgate in

          judgment on humanity. See, for example, 1 Thessalonians 5:2 and 2 Peter 3:10. Apocalypse

          suddenly, like a thief, and bringing judgment to people who may not be prepared is
          mentioned above in verse 3:3 (3.¶1) and runs throughout the four Gospels, particularly in
          parables. See, for example, Matthew 24:42–44 and Luke 12:39–40, in which Jesus’s return is
          compared to the owner of a house keeping watch, not knowing when a thief will break in. In
          a parallel to this parable, Mark 13:32–37 describes the master of a house setting his
          servants to guard the door while he is away — though in this case, they are warned to
          watch out not for thieves but for the master’s own return, whose time is unknown.
          Elsewhere in the New Testament, 1 Thessalonians 5:2 says <hi rend="italic">the day of the
            Lord</hi> (see note for <hi rend="italic">the grete day of God almighti</hi>, above)
          will come as a <hi rend="italic">theef in the night</hi> (LV). Nakedness here represents

          Isidore of Seville’s <hi rend="italic">Etymologies</hi> (seventh century) says, “Frogs
            (<hi rend="italic">rana</hi>) are named from their garrulity (compare <hi rend="italic"

          voices resound in unruly croaking” (ed. and trans. Barney, et al., 12.6.58; p. 263). The
          gloss associates the frogs’ loud croaking with false preaching that does not give people

          involving a child and an apple are unclear, though Whiting cites several proverbial
          English phrases about children loving apples that date to the fourteenth and fifteenth
          centuries: “A Child loves an apple more than a castle,” children “love an apple more than
          gold,” and “A Child’s love is lost for an apple” (Whiting, C204, C207, p. 82). It is one
          of many examples in this glossed passage of the devil working through false “clerks” and
          “prelates” — that is, priests and other officials in the church’s hierarchy — to feign
          spiritual authority and lead people astray. These clergy are described as beholden to
          three of the Seven Deadly Sins — <hi rend="italic">pride</hi><hi rend="italic">,
            coveitise</hi> [greed]<hi rend="italic">, and leccherie</hi> [lust] — and their false
          preaching is compared to the croaking of frogs in the night, which robs people of their
          rest (see note for <hi rend="italic">froschis</hi>, above). The apple trick is one example
          of the wonders and false miracles that win over worldly “princes” or rulers, and “steer
          them against” ordinary Christians. This concern that the Antichrist’s priestly followers
          would lead people astray and corrupt both the church and secular authorities was a common
          theme in fourteenth-century English religious writing, and it would become even more
          prominent after the 1370s with the popularity of John Wyclif’s anticlerical writing and
          the rise of the Lollard movement, whose anticlericalism was often even more extreme.
          Though the <hi rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi> predates the Lollards by several
          decades, the spirited anticlericalism of passages like this one is likely one reason the
          compiler of the Plimpton manuscript selected it for inclusion at the end of the otherwise
          Wycliffite New Testament. James Morey writes that “for many reform-minded medieval
          clerics, the Apocalypse was not so much the last book of the Bible that recounts the end
          of time but an allegory of how the Antichrist represents the Pope,” and points to this
          passage in particular as one that “would resonate with the most strident Lollard” (Morey,
          “The Wycliffites,” p. 93).</note>

          Communion, the ritual of eating and drinking Christ’s body and blood in the form of a
          bread wafer and wine, which took place at the altar in the front of a church and was the
          centerpiece of all medieval Christian worship services. The priest would elevate the
          wafer, also known as a “host,” and the chalice of wine above his head and then partake,
          but most non-clerical Christians would take the Eucharist only once or twice a year, for
          instance on Easter Sunday. The gloss’s insistence on people “worthily receiving” the
          sacrament is likely a reference to 1 Corinthians 11:29, the Apostle Paul’s warning that
          partaking unworthily could result in judgment, and to the church’s requirement that
          communicants go through confession and the process of penance before partaking the
          sacrament. The Eucharist was not the ritual that cleansed people of their sin, but rather
          one which united a church body with Christ through his presence. The Eucharist was also a
          flashpoint in anticlerical and philosophical debates in the late fourteenth century, as
          John Wyclif and his later followers the Lollards denied the doctrine of
          transubstantiation, the belief that bread and wine became the literal body and blood of
          Christ, and questioned whether the sacrament would lose its power if the priest himself
          had unconfessed sins. See also notes for 1.¶11, <hi rend="italic">holi prelatis</hi>,

          [flatterers]. However, its precise sense is unclear at a few points. The phrase <hi

          by establishing themselves in holy orders through ordination, or it might mean they confer

          absolution within the sacrament of penance. Either way, they do so for wrong reasons,
          either for <hi rend="italic">drede</hi>, fear of those parishioners, for <hi rend="italic"

          out of fear, or in order to win praise, or because they will face loss if they do not. The
          next sentence continues this theme and appears to reference the priests’ dishonesty in

          While it is unclear exactly why the Middle English translation cuts the angels from verse

          held up by the Apostle Paul in the New Testament as a paragon of faith. In Romans 4:1–25
          and Galatians 3:6–9, Paul draws a distinction between Abraham’s faith and his works, using
          Genesis 15:6 to argue that Christians are counted righteous in God’s eyes the same way
          Abraham was, for their faith in Christ. See also James 2:21–24, which uses Abraham’s faith
          to make a different argument about faith and works, and Hebrews 11:8–19, which recounts
          the life of Abraham as one of several ancient heroes of faith. In the gloss, Abraham’s <hi

          the twelve gemstones in the heavenly city draws from the tradition of medieval lapidaries,
          reference works on the properties of precious and semi-precious stones. Though the
          tradition was ancient and often associated with astrology and magic, Christian lapidaries
          produced by such writers as Isidore of Seville (seventh century) and Marbod of Rennes
          (twelfth century) were popular in the Middle Ages and focused on biblical references,
          including this passage from Apocalypse 21:18–21. Gemstones in the Bible, when they are
          given explicit interpretations, typically represent wisdom. See, for example, Job
          28:12–19, which lists several gemstones, along with silver and gold, and concludes that
          wisdom is more valuable than all of them. See also the descriptions of the heavenly city
          in the late fourteenth-century poem <hi rend="italic">Pearl</hi>, which are taken directly
          from the Apocalypse and include a rhyming list of the twelve stones (Andrew and Waldron,

        <note type="enote" n="154"><space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">margaritis</hi>. Pearls
          held a wide range of symbolic meanings in Christian literature of the fourteenth century.
          Two of these potential symbols are noted in the gloss for this verse (21.¶12), where the
          cleanness and brightness of a pearl represents virtue and purity. The Middle English word
            <hi rend="italic">bright</hi>, whose literal meaning refers to the physical brightness
          or a light or jewel (<hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic">bright</hi> [adj.],
          sense 1), carries the figurative sense of “morally pure, free of sin,” “enlightened,” or
          “splendid, glorious” in virtue (sense 5). An excellent source for exploring the
          multifaceted significance of pearls is the late fourteenth-century poem <hi rend="italic"
            >Pearl</hi> (Andrew and Waldron, eds., <hi rend="italic">Poems </hi><hi rend="italic">of
            the Pearl Manuscript</hi>, pp. 53–110). The “pearl” of <hi rend="italic">Pearl</hi> is
          both a young girl who has died, who appears to the narrator as a queen of heaven in a
          dream vision, and the recurring image of a precious jewel that represents spiritual truths
          to the Dreamer, who frequently refers to himself as a “jeweler.” The pearl is “wemlez
          [flawless], clene, and clere, / And endelez rounde [eternally round]” (lines 737–38),
          representing righteous perfection, truth, and eternity. The poem references Jesus’s
          parable of the Pearl of Great Price (Matthew 13:45–46), in which a merchant sells
          everything to obtain a pearl which may represent wisdom (see also Matthew 7:6), salvation,
          heaven, or Christ himself (lines 729–35). Some commentators have also noted that the size,
          shape, and color of the pearl recalls a Eucharistic wafer, the sacramental element of
          Christ’s body (see Baldwin, “Sacramental Perfection in <hi rend="italic">Pearl</hi>, <hi
            rend="italic">Patience</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Cleanness</hi>,” p. 129).</note>

          21:26 does not appear in the Anglo-Norman Apocalypse (Fridner, p. 248) and may be
          translated directly from the Vulgate or borrowed from LV. There is no commentary for it in
          the gloss below. The word MS translates as <hi rend="italic">hethene men</hi> and H as <hi
            rend="italic">the folk</hi> (see textual note, <hi rend="italic">thei schulen bryng
            glorie</hi>) is the Vulgate <hi rend="italic">gentium</hi>, meaning “the nations” and
          often translated in modern editions as “the Gentiles.” See note for 11.¶2, above.</note>

          of Jesus’s Crucifixion is frequently referred to in Middle English literature as a “tree,”
          or the “tree of death,” in ironic contrast with the Tree of Life in the Garden of Eden and
          in the New Jerusalem of the Apocalypse. See <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic"

          says that these experts, with their overly subtle readings, turn the <hi rend="italic"
