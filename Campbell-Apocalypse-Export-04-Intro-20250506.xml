        <p>The Middle English Texts Series offers a diverse and representative array of literary
          texts that medieval readers in the present-day British Isles would have encountered
          between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries. It is committed to making available both
          affordable print and open access editions to scholars, teachers, and students of the
          Western Middle Ages. In its digital publications, the series prioritizes a user-friendly
          interface and viewing options, multiple downloadable formats, enhanced searchability and
          filtering, and accessibility to the widest possible range of users.</p>
      </projectDesc>
      <editorialDecl>
        <p>METS takes as its mission the creation of affordable editions that would pass scrutiny
          from the most demanding expert, yet would prove comprehensible, and even enticing, to
          someone who had never read Middle English before. This agenda dictates that METS
          publications offer not a critical edition reflecting all surviving manuscripts, and
          certainly not a diplomatic edition, but a best-text edition, informed by the notes and
          apparatus of earlier editions (where these exist), and by substantive variants from other
          manuscript witnesses. Transcriptions of Middle English texts are lightly modernized to
          ensure a smooth reading experience, while non-English texts preserve both the original
          language and a modern English translation in facing-page format. Each edition offers
          expert assistance with language and lexicon, providing glosses alongside the text(s),
          textual and explanatory notes, elucidation of unfamiliar contexts and traditions, and
          thematic and interpretive possibilities. All editions feature general introductions that
          set the edited text within its own time, place, and traditions, and link it to ancestor,
          congener, and successor materials. All publications contain comprehensive, current
          bibliographies of pertinent scholarship and criticism. House style is adapted from the <hi
            rend="italic">Chicago Manual of Style</hi>.</p>
        <correction>
          <p>This text may include corrections made after the original edition went to press in

        <p style="heading" n="1">The <hi rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi></p>
        <p style="bodyfirst" n="1">The <hi rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi> is a Middle English
          translation of the Book of Revelation whose composition dates to the middle of the
          fourteenth century, ca. 1340–1360. Unlike the more well-known Wycliffite versions of the
          Bible which translators at the University of Oxford produced starting in the 1380s, the
            <hi rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi> does not translate Scripture directly from the
          Latin Vulgate Bible but from an intermediate source, an early fourteenth-century
          Apocalypse and commentary written in Anglo-Norman, the dialect of Old French primarily
          spoken in England in the centuries following the Norman Conquest.</p>
        <p style="body" n="1">Elis Fridner produced the first printed edition of the <hi
            rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi> in 1961 under the title <hi rend="italic">An
            English Fourteenth Century Apocalypse Version with a Prose Commentary</hi>. Since then,
          scholars have given it a variety of titles and names. James Morey refers to it, in his
          scholarship on non-Wycliffite Bible translations, as the <hi rend="italic">Apocalips of
            Jesu Crist</hi> or <hi rend="italic">AJC</hi>, after its opening line.<note target="#1"
            type="footnotelink">1</note> Walter Sauer and others have called it a “Middle English
            Apocalypse.”<note target="#2" type="footnotelink">2</note> But the simple title <hi
            rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi> seems the most appropriate, given that it is the
          very first translation of the Book of Revelation to appear in its entirety in any dialect
          of the English language. It also happens to be the title given to the text by Anna Paues,
          the first scholar to give it serious attention. Paues devoted a chapter of her 1902
          doctoral dissertation to the <hi rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi>, and she began work
          on an edition in the 1920s for the Early English Text Society which was never completed.
          She was also the first to discover the translation’s Anglo-Norman origins, and she
          identified several of its manuscripts, which before that point had been labeled as early
          drafts of the Wycliffite Bible.<note target="#3" type="footnotelink">3</note></p>
        <p style="body" n="2">The <hi rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi> survives in fifteen
          manuscripts from the fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries, which are listed in the
          section “Other Manuscripts of the <hi rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi>” below. Three
          manuscripts from the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries also reproduce the <hi
            rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi><note target="#4" type="footnotelink">4</note> but
          are not included in this total, as they are simply transcriptions of earlier extant
          copies. Twelve of the early manuscripts share enough similarities to likely derive from
          the same source, called Version A, and three represent an alternate rendering, possibly a
          later revision, called Version B. To produce his 1961 edition of Version A, Fridner
          collated eleven of the twelve extant manuscripts, from libraries in London, Oxford,
          Cambridge, and Dublin, and it has remained until now the only printed edition of the
          original text. The present edition is both an update and an extension of the work he began
          more than sixty years ago. The alternate Version B text has also been edited only once, by
          Walter Sauer in 1971, in a doctoral dissertation for Heidelberg University in Germany.</p>
        <p style="body" n="3">The one manuscript Fridner did not include in his collation in 1961 —
          in fact, he made no mention of it whatsoever, either because he was unaware of its
          existence or because he did not have access to the library where it was held in New York
          City — is in many ways the most interesting and unusual of all the extant manuscripts of
          the <hi rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi>. Columbia University MS Plimpton Add. 03,
          held at Columbia’s Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library, is a codex of 265 parchment pages.
          It contains a complete New Testament in Middle English, which takes up nearly 90 percent
          of its total volume, followed by a variety of devotional materials, including at least one
          work, <hi rend="italic">The Lollard Chronicle of the Papacy</hi>, which is directly
          related to Lollardy, the anticlerical and heretical movement inspired by John Wyclif in
          the late fourteenth century. Three other extant copies of the <hi rend="italic">English
            Apocalypse</hi> appear in manuscripts alongside Wycliffite or Lollard material, but this
          is not what makes Plimpton most unique.</p>
        <p style="body" n="4">The New Testament at the front of the codex features a total of three
          separate Middle English translations of Scripture, starting with both versions of the
          Wycliffite Bible — the Early Version (EV), which is a direct word-for-word translation
          from the Vulgate, and the Later Version (LV), which smooths out the Latinate syntax for
          English readers and uses more English idioms.<note target="#5" type="footnotelink"
            >5</note> Matti Peikola, who has exhaustively catalogued the Plimpton manuscript’s
          features and analyzed it as an example of early Lollard book production, describes its New
          Testament as representing “the transition phase from the Early to the Later Version.”<note
            target="#6" type="footnotelink">6</note> The first two books, the Gospels of Matthew and
          Mark, begin in EV, followed by a prologue to Luke which runs for one page and five lines
          (fols. 55r–55v) before it abruptly cuts off and is crossed out with red ink — apparently a
          discarded draft. A new prologue begins on a separate page, followed by the Gospel of Luke,
          now in the LV translation. This shift is also accompanied by a change in scribal hands and
          in layout, from double-column to single-column formatting. According to Peikola, only four
          other manuscripts out of the 253 Wycliffite Bible manuscripts extant show a similar
            shift,<note target="#7" type="footnotelink">7</note> making the Plimpton New Testament a
          rare example of a blended biblical text, one that may afford a valuable glimpse into the
          process of Wycliffite Bible translation and manuscript production.</p>
        <p style="body" n="5">But the Plimpton manuscript has one final surprise in store after its
          shift from EV to LV. The New Testament’s final book, the Apocalypse, begins as expected
          with the Wycliffite LV translation for the first sixteen verses, though it includes an
          interpolated commentary that none of the other New Testament books share. Then, starting
          in verse 1:17, the biblical text becomes the <hi rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi>,
          the Middle English translation from Anglo-Norman French which predates the Wycliffite
          Bible by 20–40 years. This shift is accompanied by no change in scribal hand, page layout,
          or any other signal. The producers of this manuscript, either because their copy of the EV
          or LV Apocalypse was corrupt or missing, or because their translation was not yet
          complete, or because they simply found this translation superior for reasons unknown,
          decided to replace the final book in an otherwise Wycliffite New Testament with the
          earlier, non-Wycliffite <hi rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi> — making it unique among
          all other extant copies of both the <hi rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi> and the
          Wycliffite Bible.</p>
        <p style="body" n="6">The earliest manuscripts of the <hi rend="italic">English
            Apocalypse</hi> — including British Library MS Harley 874, which provides secondary
          readings for this edition — do not include the first eight verses of the biblical text as
          they appear in Vulgate and Old French Bibles but start instead at verse 1:9. Clearly the
          exemplar from which these copies were made did not include this opening passage, which was
          either a deliberate decision by the early fourteenth-century translator (the first eight
          verses of the Book of Revelation comprise a prologue that can easily be excised) or a
          necessity because the exemplar was corrupt or missing a leaf. Whatever the reason, five
          later manuscripts, including Plimpton, replace these verses with their equivalents from
          the Wycliffite LV — proof that the producers of these <hi rend="italic">English
            Apocalypse</hi> manuscripts had multiple translations on hand and felt free to blend
          them to create the best possible edition.</p>
        <p style="body" n="7">Plimpton is unique in borrowing from the LV through verse 16, but
          another late manuscript, British Library Royal 17 A.xxvi, whose Apocalypse appears
          alongside a Wycliffite Gospel of John, continues with the LV through verse 12. Two others,
          Oxford University Bodley MS Laud Misc. 33 and Rylands Library English MS 92, extend the LV
          through verse 11. Two more, British Library Harley 3913 and Cambridge University St.
          John’s College MS G.25, feature biblical verses primarily from the Wycliffite LV and
          commentary from the <hi rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi>, a thorough blending of what
          must have begun as two separate manuscripts.<note target="#8" type="footnotelink"
          >8</note></p>
        <p style="body" n="8">In addition, the Plimpton copy of the <hi rend="italic">English
            Apocalypse</hi> exhibits influence from the Wycliffite LV that goes beyond the mere
          substitution of verses. Unlike any other manuscript, Plimpton briefly switches back to the
          LV for a few verses after the first chapter, in 3:7–22, and throughout the text, stray
          words and phrases appear to be borrowed from the LV at various points. In other words, the
            <hi rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi> as it appears in the Plimpton manuscript is a
          blended text in nearly every way, and it offers a unique glimpse into English Bible
          translation and production at a historic moment of transition. It is a prime example of
          the ways that boundaries between Wycliffite and non-Wycliffite material were often
          flexible in late fourteenth and early fifteenth-century manuscripts, as the Lollard
          producers of English Bibles took up and used earlier material that predated Archbishop of
          Canterbury Thomas Arundel’s ban on English translations in 1407, an event discussed below
          in the section titled “The Influence of Arundel’s Constitutions.”</p>
        <p style="body" n="9">The Plimpton manuscript may well have been assembled by a Lollard
          patron or a community of Lollards in defiance of this ban in the early fifteenth century,
          as part of their project to make Scripture available in the vernacular to preachers and
          lay readers. One piece of evidence to support this possibility is the manuscript’s
          entirely nondescript appearance, with no illuminations and very few decorated initials. It
          is a book which, though clearly produced by professional scribes, does not wish to draw
          attention to itself from censors or confiscators.</p>
        <p style="body" n="10">The <hi rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi> includes a prologue,
          translated from the Anglo-Norman original which is itself a translation of a
          twelfth-century Latin commentary attributed (probably falsely) to Gilbert de la Porrée,
          who died in 1154,<note target="#9" type="footnotelink">9</note> as well as an explanatory
          commentary, or “glose,” which alternates with the text after every few verses. These
          glosses are “demonstrably Franciscan,”<note target="#10" type="footnotelink">10</note>
          which places their date of composition in the mid-thirteenth century at the earliest,
          after the foundation of the Franciscan order, but anything more about their authorship or
          date of translation is unknown. The <hi rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi> manuscripts
          in general, and the Plimpton manuscript in particular, add their own anticlerical
          flourishes to the glosses, excoriating “false clerkis” (14.¶7, 16.¶11, and 17.¶¶3, 9) and
          highlighting concerns about the corruption of the priesthood and church hierarchy. These
          anticlerical insertions, which are examined in further detail in the section “The Gloss
          and Lollard Anticlericalism” below and in the Explanatory Notes, provide another possible
          explanation, in addition to the quality of the translation itself, for why a Lollard
          producer of the Plimpton New Testament might have been attracted to this text.</p>
        <p style="body" n="11">This new edition of the <hi rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi>
          uses Plimpton as its base text for all of these reasons — because it has never been edited
          before and remains relatively unexamined among Middle English biblical texts, because it
          appears at the end of a Wycliffite New Testament unlike any other extant manuscript,
          because it is a blended text which gives insight to the process of English Bible
          translation in the late fourteenth century, and because it contains a unique set of
          additions to the standard gloss. Extensive textual notes catalogue each instance of
          potential Wycliffite influence; in addition, an Appendix presents a complete edition of
          the Wycliffite LV Apocalypse for comparison. A second Appendix makes a facing-page
          comparison of Plimpton’s borrowings from the LV in chapters 1 and 3 alongside passages
          from the earliest copy of the <hi rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi>, so readers can
          see clearly what the producers of the manuscript chose to replace.</p>
        <p style="body" n="12">The edition thus serves two purposes for two types of readers. For
          students of Middle English literature and Bible translation, it provides an easy-to-read
          edition of the <hi rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi>, an influential work of Middle
          English translation which has not appeared in print for more than sixty years. For more
          advanced scholars of the Wycliffite Bible and the history of Lollard book production, the
          blended nature of the Plimpton manuscript provides a fascinating glimpse into the craft of
          medieval Bible translation and production, and the verse-by-verse decision-making process
          of compilers and scribes as they worked with at least two editions of the same biblical
          text. It is impossible to know whether the producers of the Plimpton manuscript had a copy
          of the Anglo-Norman Apocalypse and commentary which served as the origin of their Middle
          English text at hand, but doubtless they had access to the Latin Vulgate. In places where
          the Plimpton text gives an unusual reading or a unique mistranslation of the text, the
          notes offer speculation about where the irregularity might be traced and why it
          occurred.</p>
        <p style="heading" n="2">The Manuscript</p>
        <p style="bodyfirst" n="2">Columbia University MS Plimpton Add. 03, the base manuscript for
          this edition, is a codex 25 x 17 centimeters in size with 265 parchment leaves, of which
          the first 237 are a New Testament composed of three Middle English translations: the
          Wycliffite EV and LV and the <hi rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi> with commentary,
          which appears at the end of the New Testament on folios 203r–237r. According to Matti
          Peikola, the manuscript contains at least six scribal hands which can be dated
          paleographically to the early fifteenth century.<note target="#11" type="footnotelink"
            >11</note> Most of the Apocalypse is in a single hand, but one page following the
          prologue (fol. 204r) is in a smaller and more formal textura hand than the rest of the
          book. The manuscript is not illuminated, and its rubricated initial letters are typically
          two lines in height and all in the same red ink.</p>
        <p style="body" n="13">The Gospels of Matthew and Mark and part of the prologue to Luke are
          in EV, at which point the prologue cuts off, a new LV prologue to Luke begins on a
          separate page, and the MS continues in LV for the remainder of the New Testament until the
          Apocalypse, perhaps because the EV exemplar copy was corrupt or because the LV exemplar
          was incomplete. As noted above, the number of columns per page changes from two to one at
          the same point, likely in parallel with the two Wycliffite versions’ respective exemplars.
          The manuscript shifts again at verse 1:17 of the Apocalypse, to the translation referred
          to here as the <hi rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi>, though there is no corresponding
          change in scribal hand or page layout.</p>
        <p style="body" n="14">The reasons for the shift to a third translation at the end of the
          New Testament are as obscure as the reasons for the first shift but may also have involved
          a corrupt or incomplete LV translation. Peikola observes:</p>
        <quote>A manuscript like this would be a good candidate for the Later Version exemplar
          obtained by the makers of Plimpton after the corrupt text of the Early Version had to be
          discarded . . . The almost blank page at the end of the Catholic Epistles probably
          betokens that the exemplar used at that point did not contain any more text . . . Instead,
          it appears that the makers once again had to start looking for a new exemplar — this time
          one from which the Apocalypse could be copied.<note target="#12" type="footnotelink"
            >12</note></quote>
        <p style="bodyfirst" n="3">A few verses early in the <hi rend="italic">English
            Apocalypse</hi>, 1:1–16 and 3:7–22, replace the biblical text with corresponding
          passages from the LV, perhaps because the exemplar was corrupt or missing a leaf — the
          length of missing text in both instances corresponds roughly to the amount that would fit
          on a single page. However, the gloss remains keyed to the complete uncorrupted text,
          causing its language in a few places not to match the biblical text it explicates. For
          example, verse 1:13 (1.¶7) refers to “oon lyk to the sone of man,” following LV, but the
          gloss for 1:13 (1.¶8) refers to the same figure as “the maydenesse sone,” the phrasing of
          the original <hi rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi> translation as found in earlier
          uncorrupted copies. In another case later in the manuscript, the gloss interprets the
          phrase “the two colurrs that ben in the reynebowe” (4.¶2), an image from the second half
          of verse 4:3, which the manuscript for unknown reasons has dropped altogether. The
          explanatory notes for this edition thoroughly list and analyze every instance of this type
          of discrepancy, but as these two examples demonstrate, the producers of the Plimpton
          manuscript were clearly working with a complete gloss for the <hi rend="italic">English
            Apocalypse</hi>, but the exemplar for the biblical text must have been slightly
          corrupted, perhaps the impetus for the insertion of occasional LV verses.</p>
        <p style="body" n="15">In at least one intriguing case, the Wycliffite LV appears to have
          had an influence on a revision of the <hi rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi> gloss, a
          helpful reminder that textual influence does not always flow from older texts to newer,
          and revisions can be made in both directions. Like several other copies of the <hi
            rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi>, including the earliest, Plimpton mistranslates
          the Anglo-Norman word “phioles” (vials) in verse 5:8 as “fithelis” (fiddles), apparently
          by way of the Middle English “viol,” which can mean either vial or violin, resulting in
          the visually striking but inaccurate image of “harpis and fithelis of gold ful of swete
          smele” (see the explanatory notes for 5.¶3 and 5.¶4). Later manuscripts including
          Plimpton, while not correcting the mistranslation in the biblical text, add a gloss that
          is absent from earlier manuscripts and follow the LV in using the accurate, though in this
          context possibly ambiguous, “violis” (5.¶4).</p>
        <p style="body" n="16">Fridner locates the Middle English dialect of the earliest
          manuscripts of the <hi rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi> in the East Midlands of
          England and asserts that “there is no reason why the original dialect should not also have
          been EM.”<note target="#13" type="footnotelink">13</note> Paues, however, lists several
          “northerly forms” in the early manuscripts which lead her to speculate that the
          translation originated instead in the North Midlands.<note target="#14"
            type="footnotelink">14</note> Several of the forms she lists are noticeable in the early
          MS Harley 874 (H in this edition), such as a preference for the pronoun <hi rend="italic"
            >thai</hi> over <hi rend="italic">thei</hi> (Plimpton also uses <hi rend="italic"
            >thai</hi>, but far less frequently), the conjunction <hi rend="italic">oither</hi>
          where Plimpton has <hi rend="italic">either</hi> (meaning “or”), and the personal pronoun
            <hi rend="italic">Ich</hi> for <hi rend="italic">I</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Y</hi>.
          Fridner, contra Paues, claims that these variations are minor and likely reflect local
          scribal preferences. Plimpton, as with all later copies of the <hi rend="italic">English
            Apocalypse</hi>, uses the central Midlands dialect shared by the Wycliffite LV.<note
            target="#15" type="footnotelink">15</note> Perhaps the most noticeable shift from H to
          Plimpton is in the use of the conjunction <hi rend="italic">but</hi> in place of the East
          Midland <hi rend="italic">ac</hi>, though other shifts are also apparent, such as a
          complete elimination of the <hi rend="italic">ne . . . naughth</hi> double negative form.
          How far removed the Plimpton manuscript is from the Wycliffite Bible translators
          themselves we cannot know — Peikola goes no further than to say it was likely produced in
          a “metropolitan” context alongside Wycliffite Bibles, in or around Oxford or London.<note
            target="#16" type="footnotelink">16</note> Without more information about the
          translation’s origins beyond what the manuscripts can tell us, a precise location and
          dialect for the original text of the <hi rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi> is
          impossible to pinpoint.</p>
        <p style="body" n="17">Prior to the antiquarian George A. Plimpton’s acquisition of the
          manuscript, which he donated to Columbia in 1936, it belonged to the Norwich cathedral
          priory in Norfolk, a Benedictine house, though it was not likely to have been produced
          there and its texts contain no obvious connection to the Benedictines. The presence of the
          Wycliffite translations and other Lollard material indicates that the manuscript cannot
          have been produced earlier than ca. 1390, and more likely the early fifteenth century. It
          was bound in vellum over pasteboards at some point in the eighteenth century.</p>

            College Libraries</hi>.<note target="#21" type="footnotelink">21</note> The Apocalypse
          is the final book of a complete Wycliffite Bible in LV, followed by a lectionary calendar.
          The biblical texts include occasional marginal glosses, which are noted in the textual
          notes of this edition. F is internally dated to the year 1408; a note following the end of
          the Apocalypse reads, “The eer [year] of the Lord M.CCC &amp; viii this book was endid.”
          Clearly the year 1308 is too early for a Wycliffite Bible manuscript, but an erasure
          following the third C suggests that a fourth C was dropped. Solopova speculates that the
          date may have been intentionally altered to avoid censorship under Arundel’s recently
          published <hi rend="italic">Constitutions</hi>. However, she adds that “examination under
          UV light” suggests a more likely explanation: “that the scribe first wrote ‘M.ccc’ and the
          ‘and’ symbol, erased the latter, wrote it in the right place, and then forgot to insert
          the fourth ‘c.’”<note target="#22" type="footnotelink">22</note></p>

          edition of the Wycliffite LV titled <hi rend="italic">King Henry’s Bible: MS Bodley 277:
            The Revised Version of the Wyclif Bible</hi>, completed in 2004. The Apocalypse appears
          in the fourth volume, which is Stockholm Studies in English, volume 100. Lindberg’s title
          refers to a large woodcut illustration of King Henry VI pasted to one of the final leaves
          of the codex, with a Latin inscription noting that the king owned the Bible and that it
          was later donated to the London Charterhouse, a Carthusian monastery. Solopova dates the

        <p style="heading" n="5">The History of French and Anglo-Norman Bible Translation</p>
        <p style="bodyfirst" n="6">To trace the history that led to the production of the <hi
            rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi> in the mid-fourteenth century, we must start with
          the translation tradition behind its source text, the Anglo-Norman Apocalypse, and the
          texts in turn that undergird it, in particular the Old French Bible. The history of Bible
          translation in French begins in the tenth century, not long after Old French itself
          emerged as a Romance dialect, when translators began converting individual books of the
          Bible from St. Jerome’s Vulgate Latin into the vernacular, but hundreds of years before
          these efforts coalesced in the production of a full Bible. Relatively few manuscripts from
          these early years are extant until the twelfth century, a few decades after the Norman
          Conquest, when an unprecedented explosion of French translations of the Bible were
          produced, the bulk of them in England. As Paues observes in her 1902 study of Middle
          English New Testament translations, “It is a remarkable and significant fact that the
          earliest specimens of the French vernacular Bible are of Norman origin, and that the
          earliest MSS. in which they have come down to us were executed in England by Anglo-Norman
            scribes.”<note target="#24" type="footnotelink">24</note> The first book of the Bible to
          be translated into the newly emergent dialect of Anglo-Norman was the Psalms, possibly at
          the Benedictine abbey of St. Albans in the 1140s.<note target="#25" type="footnotelink"
            >25</note></p>
        <p style="body" n="22">A great flourishing of Anglo-Norman Psalters would follow and
          crescendo in the closing decades of the twelfth century. Also predominant among
          twelfth-century French productions were illustrated “Bible books,” sometimes with
          commentary, as well as liturgical aids and collections of sermons which included original
          translations of various biblical passages.<note target="#26" type="footnotelink">26</note>
          A slightly later development originating in Paris were <hi rend="italic">Bibles
            moralisées</hi>, described by Ian Short as “profusely illustrated picture books made for
          the French royal family,” which dated from the 1220s and reached England a few decades
            later.<note target="#27" type="footnotelink">27</note> The biblical texts in these <hi
            rend="italic">Bibles moralisées</hi> were selected for their moral or typological
          significance and heavily paraphrased.<note target="#28" type="footnotelink">28</note>
          Though the primary teaching aid in these stunningly beautiful and expensive productions
          was clearly their colorful pictures, they invariably included commentary translated from
          Latin as well, which came either from Berengaudus — a writer about whom nothing is known,
          who may have lived anywhere from the ninth to the eleventh century — or from another
          anonymous source.<note target="#29" type="footnotelink">29</note></p>
        <p style="body" n="23">The popularity of these richly illuminated Psalters and Bible
          paraphrases on both sides of the English Channel soon extended to other books of the
          Bible. By the middle of the thirteenth century, picture books of the Apocalypse had become
          one of the most popular luxury book productions in France and England, as measured by
          their more than eighty extant manuscripts, including two of the largest and most lavishly
          decorated, the Trinity Apocalypse (Cambridge, Trinity College, MS R.16.2, fols.1r–31v) and
          the Abingdon Apocalypse (London, British Library, Add. MS 42555, fols. 5r–82v).<note
            target="#30" type="footnotelink">30</note> The commentary that accompanied the
          illustrations and biblical text of these Apocalypses came either from the aforementioned
          Berengaudus, or from one of the other anonymous commentaries in the <hi rend="italic"
            >Bibles moralisées</hi>, whose original texts do not survive, or from the <hi
            rend="italic">Glossa Ordinaria</hi>, the ubiquitous twelfth-century compilation of
          glosses mainly from patristic sources.<note target="#31" type="footnotelink">31</note>
          Calling them works of “remarkable prestige and beauty,” Daron Burrows argues that “there
          are few events of greater importance to the history of medieval art and bookmaking than
          the production of the first illustrated manuscripts of the Apocalypse of St. John . . .
          This development is also of singular importance to francophone literature, since half of
          these manuscripts contain vernacular material, with the earliest, most important, and
          greatest number of these texts copied in Anglo-Norman.”<note target="#32"
            type="footnotelink">32</note></p>
        <p style="body" n="24">Ten of these forty vernacular Apocalypse manuscripts are cast in
          verse, in roughly octosyllabic couplets. The rest make up what is broadly known as the
          French Prose Apocalypse, the source text that would be used half a century later by the
          translators of the <hi rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi>. The translation is anonymous
          and approximately 27,000 words in length, a measure which includes both the biblical text
          and an interpolated commentary approximately twice its length. Twenty of the thirty extant
          vernacular texts, including the earliest copies, are in the Anglo-Norman dialect.<note
            target="#33" type="footnotelink">33</note> Both their language and the prominence of
          their illustrations suggest that the intended audience for these books, far from being the
          almost exclusively clerical and monastic readers of prior generations, now included the
          less educated laity.<note target="#34" type="footnotelink">34</note></p>
        <p style="body" n="25">Incredibly, no critical edition of the Anglo-Norman Apocalypse has
          yet been published. The standard edition, edited by Léopold Delisle and Paul Meyer in two
          volumes in 1900 and 1901, is not, in the editors’ own words, “une édition critique” but
          merely a transcription of a possibly corrupt text from the manuscript Bibliothèque
          Nationale de France, MS Français 403, fols. 1–45v.<note target="#35" type="footnotelink"
            >35</note> Burrows elaborates on the frustrations for scholars as a result of this
          lack:</p>
        <quote>There is no critical edition of the Prose Apocalypse, nor has there been any study of
          the textual tradition which would allow one to pronounce with any certainty on
          affiliations between manuscripts or the possibility of establishing a stemma, and this
          fundamental philological neglect only exacerbates the uncertainties surrounding other key
          questions, such as the date of the text’s composition, the identity of its anonymous
          author, the relationship of its “non-Berengaudus gloss” to the vast exegetical tradition
          on which it clearly draws, and even, despite the predominance of its transmission in
          Anglo-Norman manuscripts, on which side of the Channel it was originally written. As a
          result, the Prose Apocalypse remains shrouded by nearly as many mysteries as Jerome
          famously declared the last book of the New Testament to contain.<note target="#36"
            type="footnotelink">36</note></quote>
        <p style="bodyfirst" n="7">In his edition of the <hi rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi>,
          Fridner echoes Delisle and Meyer’s assertion that all available manuscripts of the
          Anglo-Norman Apocalypse, including their own base text, are unreliable to some degree. He
          quotes M. R. James’s observation about one such corrupt Apocalypse manuscript, the
          lavishly illuminated Bodley MS Douce 180, that it is “so carelessly (though beautifully)
          written as sometimes to make nonsense.”<note target="#37" type="footnotelink">37</note>
          Despite these potential problems, Fridner reproduced Delisle and Meyer’s transcription of
          BnF fr. 403 as a running text in his edition of the <hi rend="italic">English
            Apocalypse</hi>, in effect because he had no choice without embarking on an entirely
          separate project of producing a critical edition of the Anglo-Norman Apocalypse
            himself.<note target="#38" type="footnotelink">38</note> My own explanatory and textual
          notes on the Anglo-Norman text, when its language is relevant to an understanding of the
          English translator’s word choices, are derived from Fridner’s copy, though the original
          text can also be found in Delisle and Meyer’s edition.</p>
        <p style="body" n="26">A complete Bible in French — the first complete vernacular Bible of
          its kind to be produced in western Europe — was a somewhat later development, and it
          started with innovations in the presentation of the Vulgate text. As David Lawton points
          out, “the Bible as we most commonly experience it today, as a single portable volume with
          its books in a fixed order, and with chapter divisions, was the invention of Paris
          workshops in the 1220s and 1230s,” and was designed to meet the needs of fraternal orders,
          particularly the Dominicans, “for an individual source of authority, reference, and
          preaching material.”<note target="#39" type="footnotelink">39</note> Through the work of
          an anonymous team of translators in Paris, copies of what came to be known as the Old
          French Bible were in circulation in both France and England by 1260, with a different type
          of audience, lay readers, in mind.<note target="#40" type="footnotelink">40</note> The
          translation was based on the Vulgate Latin, with most books featuring a light to moderate
          gloss, and its goal, according to Clive Sneddon, was “rendering the Vulgate in a clear Old
          French prose which respected the register and style differences between Bible books and
          was generally accessible to readers.”<note target="#41" type="footnotelink">41</note>
          Three complete manuscripts of the Old French Bible are extant, and surviving fragments
          suggest that at least twenty-two complete copies were made.<note target="#42"
            type="footnotelink">42</note></p>
        <p style="body" n="27">In the early fourteenth century, copies of the Old French Bible begin
          appearing in “fusion” with a Bible in the Picard dialect produced by Guiart des Moulin in
          ca. 1297 called the <hi rend="italic">Bible historiale</hi>, a hybrid translation known to
          scholars today as the <hi rend="italic">Bible historiale complétée</hi>. Margriet
          Hoogvliet calls the manuscripts of this biblical fusion “one of the great successes of the
          commercial manuscript production in Paris during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries,”
          with more than 140 partial and complete copies extant.<note target="#43"
            type="footnotelink">43</note> Despite the clear popularity of complete French Bibles in
          the fourteenth century, readers in England and France would nevertheless have still been
          most likely to encounter the Bible the same way their predecessors in the early thirteenth
          century did — through fragmentary forms including illuminated manuscripts with
          abridgements and commentary, paraphrases, and individual books produced separately from
          the rest of the Bible.</p>
        <p style="body" n="28">A complete Bible in Anglo-Norman French did not appear until the
          first half of the fourteenth century, perhaps only a short while before the <hi
            rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi> translators began their work.<note target="#44"
            type="footnotelink">44</note> It is possible, though unlikely to be proven one way or
          the other, that the English translators had at their disposal both a copy of the
          Anglo-Norman Apocalypse, the primary text for their translation, and a supplementary copy
          of the Old French and/or Anglo-Norman complete Bible which included the Apocalypse.</p>
        <p style="heading" n="6">Apocalypse Commentaries</p>
        <p style="bodyfirst" n="8">The commentary that appears in the prologue and in the
          interpolated gloss of the <hi rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi>, and in the
          Anglo-Norman Apocalypse that came before it, participates in a long tradition of
          Apocalypse commentaries, especially those disseminated by the Dominican and Franciscan
          orders of friars in the twelfth to thirteenth centuries and taken up in the fourteenth
          century by English dissidents in the Lollard movement.</p>
        <p style="body" n="29">Given the complex and mysterious nature of the imagery in the Book of
          Revelation, it is no surprise that this book of the Bible inspired volumes of commentary
          from the earliest days of its inclusion in the New Testament canon. In the first centuries
          of the Common Era, commentaries on the Apocalypse proliferated and eventually broke into
          two strands — those which used the text to speculate when end times events would occur
          (usually imminently), and those which gave the text’s symbolic imagery a broader, less
          specifically predictive interpretation. Kevin Poole notes that by the late fourth century,
          “Revelation had proven itself non-predictive, and many of the major exegetes . . . began
          to read Revelation as a more symbolical or allegorical text.”<note target="#45"
            type="footnotelink">45</note> As Apocalypse editions and their accompanying commentaries
          exploded in popularity in the later Middle Ages, starting in France in the thirteenth
          century, this latter approach in Apocalypse commentaries predominated. The biblical text
          could still be used to speculate about end times events, as the commentary to the <hi
            rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi> makes clear, but just as pertinent were
          interpretations that gave its images contemporary relevance.</p>
        <p style="body" n="30">One clear example of this interpretive tradition roughly contemporary
          with the production of the Plimpton manuscript comes, ironically, from a church official
          writing in opposition to English Bible translations, in the very document that would ban
          their production. Archbishop Thomas Arundel, in his introduction to the <hi rend="italic"
            >Constitutions</hi> of 1407, writes that just as Satan comes dressed as an “angel of
          light,” so those who wish to destroy the church also come in deceptively pleasant
          garb:</p>
        <quote>. . . by which the emblem in the Apocalypse is verified, “one sitting on a black
          horse held a balance in his hand.” By this heretics are meant, who allure people to them
          with an appearance of what is right and just under the figure of a balance, but afterwards
          comes the horse with his black tail scattering poisonous errors . . .”<note target="#46"

        <p style="bodyfirst" n="9">The black horse of Revelation 6:5 appears here not as a figure of
          end times catastrophe but as a present danger in the contemporary church, a generalized
          heretic who uses the appearance of justice to mask hypocrisy and lead Christians
          astray.</p>
        <p style="body" n="31">The early twelfth century saw the production of the <hi rend="italic"
            >Glossa Ordinaria</hi>, the compendium of patristic glosses in Latin that was largely
          the work of French theologian Anselm of Laon and his school. In its wake, the production
          of Apocalypse commentaries multiplied throughout the twelfth and thirteenth centuries,
          many of the most prominent written by members of monastic and fraternal orders: the
          Benedictine Rupert of Deutz, the Cistercian Joachim of Fiore, the Augustinian Richard of
          St. Victor, the Dominican Hugh of St. Cher, and Franciscans such as Alexander of Bremen,

          of the monastic and fraternal orders, one of those targets was the corruption of the
          institutional church, from which they saw themselves standing apart. The church would also
          be a ripe target in the commentaries of the Lollards, who had perhaps more of a reason
          than members of religious orders to view themselves as alienated. The commentary in the
          Anglo-Norman Apocalypse is almost certainly Franciscan in origin,<note target="#49"
            type="footnotelink">49</note> and Franciscans in the thirteenth century shared the later
          Lollard movement’s concerns about corruption in the secular priesthood. The Anglo-Norman
          Apocalypse commentary’s frequent invocations of “false prelatis” and “false clerkis”
          (false prelates and false clerics; see 14.¶7, 16.¶11, and 17.¶¶3, 9) refer not to the
          friars themselves, of course, but to the clergy and other officials within the church’s
          hierarchy, who need to be raised from their moral degradation lest they face the same
          divine judgment as hypocrites and heretics. Lollard polemicists were accustomed to
          attacking not only these hypocritical priests but the religious orders themselves in their
          sweeping critiques. Their wide-ranging anticlericalism swept up secular priests, monks,
          and friars alike — which is part of what makes their attraction to an Apocalypse
          commentary with Franciscan roots noteworthy.</p>
        <p style="body" n="33">Scholars looking for explanations for the sudden proliferation of
          Apocalypse books and commentaries in thirteenth-century England and France frequently
          point, at least in part, to the emergence of apocalyptic ideas among friars specifically.
          The two most recently established fraternal orders in the thirteenth century, the
          Franciscans and the Dominicans, had a particular reason to be attracted to the Book of
          Revelation — they saw themselves in it, particularly in the description of “two witnessis”
          in chapter 11 who preach for 1,260 days while dressed in sackcloth, shortly before the
          Beast appears on the earth in the end times (see 11.¶¶4–5 of the <hi rend="italic">English
            Apocalypse</hi>, which interprets the two witnesses as the prophets Enoch and Elijah).
          This passage was important to the new orders, Nigel Morgan writes, because they “saw
          themselves as the new apostles of the thirteenth century.”<note target="#50"
            type="footnotelink">50</note> This interpretation can be traced to the writings of
          Joachim of Fiore, the Cistercian monk who founded his own branch of the order in the late
          twelfth century and predicted that a new age in the history of mankind, the Third Age or
          Age of the Holy Spirit, would begin in the year 1260 — an echo of the 1,260 days of
          Revelation 11:3.<note target="#51" type="footnotelink">51</note> Joachim may or may not be
          primarily responsible for the Apocalypse’s surge in interest — after all, lay readers
          outside the religious orders who likely did not read Joachim engaged with these texts as
          well — but it was shortly after the dissemination of his prophecies and his death in 1202
          that vernacular prose translations of the Apocalypse, with their accompanying
          commentaries, began to appear in England and France.<note target="#52" type="footnotelink"
            >52</note></p>
        <p style="body" n="34">These commentaries did not, as noted above, always keep their
          interpretations safely ensconced in the future of end times events, but used them to
          critique people and institutions in the present. The Franciscan Peter John Olivi, for
          example, drawing on Joachim’s prophecies, described in his Apocalypse commentary a “double
          Antichrist” who would come in the future, but who would capture the papacy because the
          contemporary institution was already corrupt and open to Satan’s wiles — a claim, among
          others, that led to his posthumous condemnation by Pope John XXII in 1326.<note
            target="#53" type="footnotelink">53</note> Much of the interest in the Apocalypse at
          this time revolved around the figure of the Antichrist, and the question of who in the
          contemporary world he might represent. One likely candidate in the thirteenth century was
          Frederick II, the Holy Roman Emperor who ruled much of Europe and was frequently at war
          with the papacy. Drawing on language from the Apocalypse, Pope Gregory IX wrote in a
          letter to Archbishop of Canterbury Edmund Rich in 1239, “The beast filled with the names
          of blasphemy has risen from the sea . . . this beast Frederick, called emperor.”<note
            target="#54" type="footnotelink">54</note> But monarchs and nations in conflict with the
          church were not the only potential targets — by the late fourteenth century, virtually any
          leader in the church or government might earn the label of Antichrist, either as a
          prophetic precursor to the figure in the Apocalypse or as the very man.</p>
        <p style="body" n="35">John Wyclif began referring to the pope as Antichrist as early as the
          1370s, in treatises such as <hi rend="italic">De Civili Dominio</hi> [<hi rend="italic">On
            Civil Dominion</hi>] (ca. 1375), <hi rend="italic">De Dominio Divino</hi> [<hi
            rend="italic">On Divine Dominion</hi>] (ca. 1376), and <hi rend="italic">De
            Ecclesia</hi> [<hi rend="italic">On the Church</hi>] (ca. 1378). Pope Gregory XI reigned
          during this stretch of Wyclif’s career, but the papacy itself would soon be divided in
          1378, with separate lines at Rome and Avignon, a schism which no doubt encouraged Wyclif,
          his Lollard followers, and other English anticlerical writers increasingly to view the
          institution as illegitimate. The Antichrist in their view was not a vague future threat
          but an active present danger to the church — to be precise, the “ghostly” or spiritual
          church made up of true Christian believers, to whom the pope and other officials might not
          even belong. “The high priests of Antichrist,” Wyclif wrote in <hi rend="italic">De
            Simonia</hi>, “are able to condemn and destroy Christ’s members because the latter
          universally reprove their sins.”<note target="#55" type="footnotelink">55</note></p>
        <p style="body" n="36">The central difference between Wyclif’s polemic and that of the
          Franciscans and other apocalyptically- inclined friars who came before him is that
          Wyclif’s targets included the fraternal orders, whom he believed had fallen from the
          purity of their founders’ original intentions. One of the short texts that accompanies the
          New Testament in the Plimpton manuscript is a good example of this type of critique — a
          prophecy attributed apocryphally to the twelfth-century Hildegard of Bingen, which cites
          Osee 4:8 in predicting that “ther schal rise a maner of folk . . . holdynge the ordres of
          begeres, walkyng withouten schame, finding many new wickidnessese,” a reference the
          prophecy’s commentary applies to friars.<note target="#56" type="footnotelink">56</note>
          The later Lollards would extend and intensify this type of critique so that by the
          fifteenth century, the Lollard tract <hi rend="italic">The Lanterne of Light</hi> would
          include friars in its depiction of Antichrist as a giant serpent, with the pope at its
          head, bishops as its body, and the “sects” of religious orders as its tail. The tract
          gives the following reading to the image of the Beast in Revelation 16:</p>
        <quote>That is to mene archebischopis and bischopis ben the seet of the beest Anticrist, for
          in hem he sittith and regneth over othir peple in the derknes of his heresie; and in this
          thei deliten hem . . . in the court of Rome is the heed of Anticrist and in archebischopis
          and bischopis is the bodi of Anticrist. But in thise cloutid [rag-tag] sectis, as mounkis,
          chanouns, and freris [friars] is the venymous taile of Anticrist.<note target="#57"
            type="footnotelink">57</note></quote>
        <p style="bodyfirst" n="10">The commentary in the Plimpton manuscript’s <hi rend="italic"
            >English Apocalypse</hi> is not quite so explicit in making these connections, but it
          does describe the Antichrist as a type of seductive preacher, drawing followers to him
          with the power of his speech and false teaching, and it describes some of those followers
          as various types of clergy. For example, the gloss for verses 13:11–18 that appears in
          13.¶9 features a substantial length of commentary that is original to the <hi
            rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi> — it does not have an Anglo-Norman source —
          centering around the Antichrist and his disciples, all of them “ypocritis and eretikis,”
          and many of them “prelatis,” or church officials. These prelates “doone her synne of
          leccherie priveli” while hypocritically keeping a righteous outer appearance, and the
          commentary goes on to accuse the church of rampant simony and claim that men “go to the
          ordre” — join the priesthood or a religious order — “to han bodili delites.” The gloss for
          verses 14:9–10 in 14.¶7 makes a further connection between the Antichrist and the church:
          “alle that ben drawun to the fals techyng of Anticrist and conformith hym to the vices of
          his discipils, tho [those] ben the false profetis and false clerkis that ben proud and
          coveitouse and leccherouse and losengouris [flatterers].” These false prophets and clerics
          play a role in bringing the future end-times horrors of the book, but they are just as
          clearly meant to represent contemporary church officials.</p>
        <p style="body" n="37">The gloss’s invocation of the Antichrist, as well as its
          multi-pronged attack on the clergy’s pride, greed, lechery, and other vices (see
          explanatory note 14.¶7 on the wide range of meanings for the insult “losengouris”), drew
          inspiration from the French Apocalypse commentaries produced by religious orders in
          generations past, but it would also have sat comfortably alongside the most strident
          Lollard critiques of the late fourteenth century — as the Lollard compiler of the Plimpton
          manuscript clearly intuited.</p>
        <p style="heading" n="7">The Early History of English Bible Translation</p>
        <p style="bodyfirst" n="11">Anglo-Norman’s popularity as a literary language in England in
          the centuries following the Norman Conquest explains in part why Middle English
          translations of Scripture do not appear in great volume until the middle of the fourteenth
          century. The <hi rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi> does not appear until approximately
          one hundred years after the Anglo-Norman Apocalypse translation, long after the heyday of
          the great illuminated Apocalypse books in Old French. This history also explains why a
          Middle English translator might choose a French text as the source for a biblical
          translation and view it as trustworthy. Neither the class distinctions of the late
          fourteenth century, which came to see French as primarily a courtly or diplomatic
          language, nor the anti-French antipathies of the Hundred Years’ War, which began in
          earnest in the 1340s with Edward the Black Prince’s incursions into France, were likely to
          be relevant to an English translator in the first half of the fourteenth century.
          Translating a biblical text from French to English was clearly not viewed as problematic,
          either socially or politically. But language practices in England were changing, and the
          great flourishing of Middle English biblical material that would culminate in the
          Wycliffite Bible editions at the end of the century was well underway by even the earliest
          possible date of the first <hi rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi> manuscript in ca.
          1340.</p>
        <p style="body" n="38">English translations of the Bible have their own separate historical
          track, dating back to the emergence of the English language. King Alfred in the ninth
          century commissioned a Pentateuch and a Psalter in the dialect we now call Old English,
          and other parts of the Bible such as the Psalms and Christ’s Passion survive in Old
          English as well, though by the fourteenth century, these texts could not be understood by
          most readers. In Middle English, several verse adaptations of Latin abridgements of
          Scripture appeared starting in the thirteenth century — for example, the rhyming metrical
            <hi rend="italic">Genesis and Exodus</hi> (ca. 1250) and <hi rend="italic">Iacob and
            Iosep</hi> [<hi rend="italic">Jacob and Joseph</hi>] (ca. 1250). The massive <hi
            rend="italic">Cursor Mundi</hi> [<hi rend="italic">Runner of the World</hi>] (ca. 1300),
          with its 29,555 lines of mostly rhyming couplets, covers the entire Bible in paraphrase,
          as well as an apocryphal account of Jesus’s childhood. Many other works of Middle English
          poetry retell stories from the Bible and on occasion directly translate portions of
          Scripture. These include the works of the <hi rend="italic">Gawain</hi>-Poet, anonymous
          author of <hi rend="italic">Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</hi> as well as <hi
            rend="italic">Pearl</hi>, whose vision of the heavenly New Jerusalem quotes directly
          from Revelation; <hi rend="italic">Patience</hi>, which retells the Book of Jonah and
          quotes from the Beatitudes; and <hi rend="italic">Cleanness</hi>, which recounts several
          stories of God’s wrath from the Books of Genesis and Daniel. Other Middle English biblical
          translations include Gospel harmonies, Gospel commentaries with quotations and
          paraphrases, a stanzaic Life of Christ, a translation of Matthew and Acts in a Midlands
          dialect, a Southwestern dialect translation of the Pauline and Catholic Epistles, a
          metrical paraphrase of the Old Testament (ca. 1380), and numerous editions of the Psalms,
          including the Surtees Psalter (ca. 1300) and the Midlands Glossed Prose Psalter (ca.
          1350), which features alternating lines in Latin and English.<note target="#58"
            type="footnotelink">58</note></p>
        <p style="body" n="39">Psalters of all kinds were immensely popular throughout the
          fourteenth century and were often produced in stand-alone editions for a variety of
          liturgical uses. In her book-length study of English psalters in the fourteenth and
          fifteenth centuries, Annie Sutherland mentions several produced in England which contain
          both Middle English and Anglo-Norman Psalms alongside their Vulgate originals, to produce
          a “three-fold Psalter.”<note target="#59" type="footnotelink">59</note> The popularity of
          these trilingual biblical productions may provide another glimpse into the origins of the
            <hi rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi>, and further explanation for why an English
          translator might be interested in translating the biblical text from French. In the early
          decades of the fourteenth century, both languages appear to have had equal status for a
          broad range of readers, and occasionally shared space within the same manuscript. The
          translators of the <hi rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi> no doubt had similar goals to
          the later Wycliffite translators — to make texts that were already widespread and popular,
          but perhaps becoming inaccessible to a growing number of readers, available to all.</p>
        <p style="body" n="40">It is unclear which of these earlier translations, paraphrases, and
          poetic renderings of the Bible the Oxford translators in the late fourteenth century would
          have known about and read. Any debt they may owe to them as inspirations or models for
          their own translations does not appear overtly in the biblical texts. However, one work of
          English Bible translation we can say with certainty the Wycliffite translators knew, in
          addition to the <hi rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi>, was the Psalter translated by
          the mystic Richard Rolle of Hampole. Extant in forty manuscripts, Rolle’s prose
          translations were completed sometime shortly before his death in 1349.<note target="#60"
            type="footnotelink">60</note> They are a valuable resource for any student of medieval
          translation theory, since in addition to recording Latin and English verses on alternating
          lines, Rolle also includes commentary on each verse and occasionally on his reasons for
          particular translation choices.</p>
        <p style="body" n="41">Rolle’s Psalter was a particular favorite of the Lollards, who
          reproduced the text in their own glossed versions. Nearly half of Rolle’s extant
          manuscripts contain Lollard interpolations in addition to his own commentary, many of
          which express anticlerical attitudes and heighten Rolle’s more generalized suspicion of
          the institutional church. As a translation that predates the Wycliffite versions, Rolle’s
          work had the benefit for later Lollards of prior approval from church authorities — since
          his translations long predated fifteenth-century restrictions on new Bible translations,
          owning and copying and even annotating his works were not practices likely to run afoul of
          church censors or confiscators. In fact, until the Wycliffite versions appeared roughly
          forty years later, Rolle’s Psalter was, according to Margaret Deanesly, “the standard
          English version of the psalms.”<note target="#61" type="footnotelink">61</note> Rolle’s
          Psalter as glossed and expanded by the Lollards provides an interesting parallel to
          Plimpton’s <hi rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi>, as in both cases an already popular
          biblical text was appropriated and placed within a new, and newly dissident, context.</p>
        <p style="body" n="42">Sutherland explores a range of theoretical positions that guided
          various translations of the Psalms in the English fourteenth century, from Rolle to the
          Wycliffite versions. The “close literalism” of Rolle’s Psalm translations, for instance,
          suggests that he had a reading audience in mind who was at least somewhat familiar with
          Latin and may have used it as a supplement for learning the language.<note target="#62"
            type="footnotelink">62</note> This speculation parallels what some scholars have claimed
          about the Wycliffite EV and its sometimes awkward Latinate phrasing, for example Henry
          Ansgar Kelly, who argues against the idea that the EV was merely a first draft and instead
          was “foreseen as having a permanent value in assisting persons with only elementary Latin,
          particularly run-of-the-mill clergy, to use as a guide to understanding the Latin
            text.”<note target="#63" type="footnotelink">63</note> In the case of Rolle, a reader
          who found his literal translation confusing could also have recourse to “the more
          idiomatic translation often embedded in the commentary,”<note target="#64"
            type="footnotelink">64</note> an interesting parallel to the more idiomatic English of
          the Wycliffite LV, which in Kelly’s words “systematically de-Latinizes EV.”<note
            target="#65" type="footnotelink">65</note></p>
        <p style="body" n="43">In general, though, rather than conceptualizing the English psalter
          translation tradition as a “chain,” with one text simply influencing the next, Sutherland
          imagines instead “a nexus of connections in which texts have the freedom to respond to
          each other critically as well as imitatively,” often in unexpected ways.<note target="#66"
            type="footnotelink">66</note> A similar imagination must be deployed to understand the
          potential connections between the <hi rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi> and the
          Wycliffite translations of Revelation. The former was produced definitively earlier in
          history, and our natural inclination might be to imagine its influence moving
          chronologically forward toward the later texts. However, despite the Oxford translators’
          almost certain knowledge of the <hi rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi>, it does not
          appear that they used it in any discernible way as a foundation or model for their own
          Apocalypse version. If anything, the textual evidence in Plimpton and other manuscripts
          suggests that influence flowed in the other direction — as scribes used the Wycliffite LV
          to revise and refine the <hi rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi> that was part of their
          New Testament. The Wycliffite translators were apparently scrupulous about keeping their
          Latin-to-English translation project separate from the French-to-English translation they
          likely had access to, even if the compilers and producers of their Bibles were more
          liberal in their willingness to blend texts.</p>
        <p style="heading" n="8">The Apocalypse and Middle English Poetry</p>
        <p style="bodyfirst" n="12">A familiarity with the imagery and themes of the biblical
          Apocalypse is exceedingly valuable for students of Middle English literature, given the
          profound influence it had for centuries on the medieval Christian imagination, in
          particular on the poetic literature composed at roughly the same time as the <hi
            rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi>. The great Middle English dream vision poem <hi
            rend="italic">Pearl</hi>, for example, renders the Apostle John’s description of the
          heavenly city of New Jerusalem in highly elaborate poetic verse, in the service of a
          grieving father’s vision of the afterlife. In her analysis of the poem, Susanna Fein
          discusses the traditional medieval association of the Apostle John with jewelry, derived
          from his cataloging of the city’s precious gems in Revelation 21:18–21 (21.¶¶8–10 in the
            <hi rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi>), a process the “jeweler” narrator of <hi
            rend="italic">Pearl</hi> echoes in his own descriptions of the heavenly city.<note
            target="#67" type="footnotelink">67</note> Fein also draws attention to the ways the <hi
            rend="italic">Pearl</hi> poet drew visual inspiration from the illuminated Apocalypse
          volumes in Old French.<note target="#68" type="footnotelink">68</note> Ann Meyer’s work on
          medieval allegory and the Apocalypse examines <hi rend="italic">Pearl</hi> as well and
          explores the ways that even church architecture, in addition to other cultural and
          literary productions, can be “understood as earthly representations of the New
            Jerusalem.”<note target="#69" type="footnotelink">69</note></p>
        <p style="body" n="44"><hi rend="italic">Piers Plowman</hi>, William Langland’s epic dream
          vision in alliterative Middle English verse, composed in at least three stages in the
          final decades of the fourteenth century, also makes numerous allusions to the Apocalypse,
          as Morton Bloomfield details in his influential study <hi rend="italic">Piers Plowman as a
            Fourteenth-Century Apocalypse</hi>. Bloomfield highlights Langland’s role as a social
          and ecclesiastical reformer, who employs apocalyptic imagery to describe clerical
          corruption and express hope for a renewal of the church — concerns shared by both the
          gloss commentary of the <hi rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi> and Langland’s Lollard
          contemporaries. In particular, Bloomfield draws attention to the poem’s Harrowing of Hell
          scene — Christ’s descent after his crucifixion to release captive souls, also a popular
          subject in medieval art and drama — which he describes as a “foreshadowing of the Last
          Judgment,” after which Langland depicts the coming of Antichrist and the triumphant return
          of Christ.<note target="#70" type="footnotelink">70</note> Kathryn Kerby-Fulton, in a book
          that both challenges and expands on Bloomfield’s work, traces Langland’s many predecessors
          and influences who were both exegetes of the Apocalypse and apocalyptic visionaries
          themselves — Hildegard of Bingen, Bridget of Sweden, William of St. Amour, and Joachim of
          Fiore, among others — and outlines Langland’s own “ideology of reform” for the church, a
          new form of apocalypticism which she argues is both apocalyptic and optimistic about the
            future.<note target="#71" type="footnotelink">71</note></p>
        <p style="body" n="45">As much of the scholarship cited here makes clear, it was not only
          biblical texts and commentaries but the physical, visual presentation of illuminated
          manuscripts that spurred the imaginations of Middle English poets — and a consideration of
          both text and visual art is essential for understanding the enduring resonance of
          apocalyptic imagery for medieval English readers. In addition to the many digitized images
          of manuscripts available through institutions such as the Bodleian Library in Oxford and
          the British Library in London (a complete set of images from the oldest extant copy of the
            <hi rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi>, MS Harley 874, is freely available on the
          British Library’s website), many recent publications have also helped to make this rich
          primary material more accessible to students and scholars. These include facsimiles and
          illustrated editions of manuscripts like the Abingdon Apocalypse and Trinity Apocalypse,
          as well as scholarship on Apocalypse material which features visual reproductions of
          select manuscript pages.<note target="#72" type="footnotelink">72</note></p>
        <p style="heading" n="9">Production of the Wycliffite Bible</p>
        <p style="bodyfirst" n="13">The English translations of the Bible produced at Oxford
          University in late fourteenth century, known collectively as the Wycliffite Bible, survive
          in more manuscript copies than any other work produced in Middle English. These 253
          manuscripts include twenty full Bibles and hundreds of partial copies, in many cases
          constituting only the Old or New Testament, the Psalms, the Gospels, or single books of
          the Bible, and including four manuscripts that contain the Apocalypse alone.<note
            target="#73" type="footnotelink">73</note> By comparison, the second most well preserved
          Middle English text, the anonymous poem <hi rend="italic">Prik of Conscience</hi>, has 131
          copies extant in several different versions,<note target="#74" type="footnotelink"
            >74</note> followed by Nicholas Love’s <hi rend="italic">The Mirror of the Blessed Life
            of Jesus Christ</hi> with sixty-one copies.<note target="#75" type="footnotelink"
            >75</note> Geoffrey Chaucer’s <hi rend="italic">Canterbury Tales</hi> has
            fifty-five.<note target="#76" type="footnotelink">76</note> Manuscripts of the
          Wycliffite LV outnumber the EV by more than five to one, but the Wycliffite EV alone still
          far outstrips most other works of Middle English literature in popularity.</p>
        <p style="body" n="46">The survival of so many copies of the text speaks to a huge
          production and distribution network, one that likely could only have been achieved at
          Oxford with multiple translators and the institutional support of the university. The
          survival of so many complete New Testaments, Old Testaments, and whole Bibles also attests
          to a philosophy of translation and biblical completeness and coherence not seen in any
          Middle English translation project prior to that point. According to Lawton, the Oxford
          translators’ “project of comprehensive vernacular Bible translation was probably an
          inevitable response to the Paris Bible as disseminated by friars from the 1240s.”<note
            target="#77" type="footnotelink">77</note> As with the Old French Bible production of
          the thirteenth century, the process had to begin with establishing a complete and
          relatively stable text of the Latin Bible.</p>
        <p style="body" n="47">The self-named “symple creature” who wrote Chapter 15 of the
          Wycliffite Bible’s General Prologue — who may or may not have been one of the project’s
          translators, as he claims — describes the next step in the translation process as
          consulting several Bible commentaries, with a possible reference to the <hi rend="italic"
            >Glossa Ordinaria</hi> or “common gloss”:</p>
        <quote>a symple creature hath translatid the Bible out of Latyn into English. First this

        <p style="bodyfirst" n="14">The simple creature claims that the Bible is translated solely
          from the Latin, but he also mentions glosses and commentaries which help to establish a
          stable Latin text. Given that the Wycliffite translators knew of the earlier <hi
            rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi>, it seems at least possible that its gloss is one
          of these documents — though any evidence from the text of the Wycliffite Apocalypse
          versions, if it exists at all, is likely impossible to retrieve.</p>
        <p style="body" n="48">Prior to the late fourteenth century, the institutional church was
          not hostile to Bible translation into vernacular languages. Pope Innocent III gave the
          practice explicit approval in 1199, with the caveat that only qualified readers should
          attempt to interpret Scripture.<note target="#79" type="footnotelink">79</note> At around
          the same time as Pope Innocent’s approval, complete editions of the Bible became popular
          in churches and among the wealthy laity in France, including large two-volume Bibles
          designed for public reading from church lecterns, and a relatively compact volume for
          individual readers known as the Parisian Bible. All of these Bibles, however, were in
          Latin. The appearance of the first Old French Bible is a mystery, as no preface explains
          where or why it was produced, but it was likely connected with the University of Paris and
          completed at least a few years before its earliest extant manuscript copy in ca.
            1260.<note target="#80" type="footnotelink">80</note> The Old French Bible thus predated
          the Wycliffite Bible by more than a century, and it was used both by readers in France and
          French-speaking readers in post-Conquest England, as was the Anglo-Norman Apocalypse and
          the <hi rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi> when they appeared in the fourteenth
          century, with no apparent condemnation from the church.</p>
        <p style="body" n="49">The English church’s eventual hostility toward vernacular Bible
          translation in the late fourteenth century had less to do with any threat from the Bibles
          themselves and more to do with the perceived threats of the men who produced them, and
          their heretical positions on theological subjects only indirectly related to Bible
          translation. The Blackfriars council of 1382, convened by Archbishop of Canterbury William
          Courtenay, condemned twenty-four positions of Wyclif and his followers as erroneous,
          starting with their belief that the elements of the Eucharist retained their “substance”
          as bread and wine after consecration — the first three of the council’s condemnations
          dealt with this heretical position against the doctrine of transubstantiation. Other
          errors that followed in the list included the belief that priests could not effectively
          administer sacraments while in a state of mortal sin (a heresy known as Donatism), that
          the pope has no authority if he is evil, that every Christian may preach the gospel
          without license from the church, that civil authorities have the right to dispossess
          clergy of their possessions, that monastic and fraternal orders are illegitimate, and that
          friars should live by the work of their hands rather than by begging for alms.<note
            target="#81" type="footnotelink">81</note> None of these condemnations made any mention
          of English Bible translation. Only when some of the same men whose views had been
          condemned by the council — John Purvey, Nicholas Hereford, John Trevisa, and possibly
          Wyclif himself — became involved in producing an English Bible translation at Oxford did
          church officials take notice and add it to the long list of Lollard errors they believed
          endangered the orthodox faithful.</p>
        <p style="body" n="50">Wyclif was not formally charged by the Blackfriars council nor even
          named in their condemnation,<note target="#82" type="footnotelink">82</note> and he would
          not be convicted of heresy in his lifetime, though the Council of Constance would declare
          his works heretical in 1415, more than twenty years after his death. Nevertheless, the
          Blackfriars condemnation forced him to resign his position at Oxford and he retired to his
          parish at Lutterworth. In the months that followed, his associates Nicholas Hereford and
          Philip Repingdon, in the words of historian John Dahmus, “proceeded to turn Oxford into a
          hotbed of Lollardy.”<note target="#83" type="footnotelink">83</note> Hereford, Repingdon,
          and Purvey were all eventually found guilty of heterodox beliefs and imprisoned, and under
          threat of death they eventually recanted — though Purvey would later recant his
          recantation and flee, possibly to join forces with the famous Lollard rebel Sir John
            Oldcastle.<note target="#84" type="footnotelink">84</note> This history set the stage
          for Arundel’s <hi rend="italic">Constitutions</hi> in 1407, which expressed the church’s
          new fear of a heretical uprising directly connected to the new English Bible translation
          and its disseminators.</p>
        <p style="heading" n="10">The Influence of Arundel’s <hi rend="italic"
          >Constitutions</hi></p>
        <p style="bodyfirst" n="15">The precise connections between Wyclif’s teaching on subjects
          such as the Eucharist and civil dominion and his championing of an English Bible are
          fraught and debatable to modern scholars, but to church officials in the early fifteenth
          century, the link between Wyclif’s heresies and Bible translation seemed to become
          increasingly clear. The extent of his involvement in the translation project itself is
          doubtful — this question will be addressed more thoroughly in the next section below — but
          the Oxford philosopher had an explicit and persistent belief in the importance of biblical
          material being made available to lay readers directly, in part to counteract what he
          viewed as corrupt interpretations from officials in the church, from parish priests to
          monks and friars and even to the pope. In his treatise <hi rend="italic">On the Truth of
            Holy Scripture</hi> from ca. 1378, Wyclif argues that “in order to prevent some
          pseudo-disciples from pretending that they have received their understanding directly from
          God, God established a common Scripture which is perceptible to the senses, by means of
          which the catholic sense should be comprehended.”<note target="#85" type="footnotelink"
            >85</note> The General Prologue to the Wycliffite LV offers a similar defense of the
          English translation project as beneficial for the “lewd” or uneducated laity:</p>
        <quote>For though couetouse clerkis ben wode [driven mad] bi symonie, eresie and manie
          othere synnes, and dispisen and stoppen holi writ as myche as thei moun [can], yit the

          peril of here [their] lif.<note target="#86" type="footnotelink">86</note></quote>
        <p style="bodyfirst" n="16">Wyclif and his followers pitted themselves directly against the
          church’s representatives — and if the connection between the translation project and
          Wyclif’s sacramental heresy was tenuous, the church would nevertheless err on the side of
          caution. Spurred by the perceived threat of Lollardy, Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas
          Arundel presided over a convocation at Oxford in November 1407 which published ten
          proclamations against the Lollards known as Arundel’s <hi rend="italic"
          >Constitutions</hi>. Among other strictures, the <hi rend="italic">Constitutions
          </hi>ruled that both ownership of the new English translation of the Bible and production
          of any future English translations would be restricted to those who secured a license in
          advance. After passing at Oxford, the <hi rend="italic">Constitutions</hi> were confirmed
          at a later convocation in London and published on April 13, 1409.<note target="#87"
            type="footnotelink">87</note></p>
        <p style="body" n="51">The sixth of Arundel’s <hi rend="italic">Constitutions</hi>, which
          sets the limits on English Bible translation, is worth quoting at length, to determine
          what exactly it purports to ban and under what circumstances:</p>
        <quote>It is dangerous, as St. Jerome declares, to translate the text of Holy Scripture out
          of one idiom into another, since it is not easy in translations to preserve exactly the
          same meaning in all things . . . We therefore command and ordain that henceforth no one
          translate the text of Holy Scripture into English or any other language in a book,
          booklet, or tract, and that no one read any book, booklet, or tract of this kind lately
          made in the time of the said John Wyclif or since, or that hereafter may be made either in
          part or wholly, either publicly or privately, under pain of excommunication until such
          translation shall have been approved and allowed by the diocesan of the place, or (if need
          be) by the Provincial Council. He who shall act otherwise let him be punished as an
          abettor of heresy and error.<note target="#88" type="footnotelink">88</note></quote>
        <p style="bodyfirst" n="17">The eighteenth-century English translator of the <hi
            rend="italic">Constitutions</hi>, John Johnson, whose editorial commentary indulges in
          anti-Catholic polemic, observes that the language of “book, booklet, or tract” (<hi
            rend="italic">libri</hi>, <hi rend="italic">libelli</hi>, <hi rend="italic">aut
            tractatus</hi>) could potentially encompass texts beyond mere Bible translation and is
          both broad and vague enough that “this net seems to be made for the catching or letting go
          whomsoever and whatsoever they pleased.”<note target="#89" type="footnotelink">89</note>
          At the same time, the decree does not appear to condemn Wyclif directly, but merely any
          translation made “in his time” or afterward. The <hi rend="italic">Constitutions</hi> do
          not condemn all English Bible translations, only unlicensed ones, and even then the
          potential crime is not owning them but “reading” them before they have been approved by
          proper authorities. Arundel’s central motive appears to be preventing future translation
          efforts that might introduce heretical elements into the text. What is unclear, and a
          running debate for historians of the early fifteenth century, is whether existing
          translations, namely the Wycliffite Bible versions which do not feature openly heretical
          material, are meant to be included in the strictures. Was it dangerous, after 1409, to
          produce or own a manuscript with an already existing English translation of Scripture?</p>
        <p style="body" n="52">In a hugely influential 1995 article entitled “Censorship and
          Cultural Change in Late Medieval England: Vernacular Theology, the Oxford Translation
          Debate, and Arundel’s <hi rend="italic">Constitutions</hi> of 1409,” Nicholas Watson made
          the case that Arundel’s decrees were “the linchpin of a broader attempt to limit religious
          discussion and writing in the vernacular,”<note target="#90" type="footnotelink">90</note>
          and that their dissemination marked a major shift from the late fourteenth century, when
          works of vernacular theology flourished, to the early fifteenth century, when
          self-censorship hampered this burgeoning literary movement. Debates about Arundel’s legacy
          since then have tended to position themselves in relation to Watson’s argument. While many
          have quibbled over the contention that vernacular theology all but disappeared after 1409,
          for reasons detailed below, most agree that <hi rend="italic">something</hi> happened to
          change the landscape for vernacular religious writers.</p>
        <p style="body" n="53">The anthology <hi rend="italic">After Arundel</hi>, the published
          culmination of an Oxford University conference on the <hi rend="italic">Constitutions</hi>
          on their 600th anniversary, spotlights a variety of perspectives on Arundel’s legacy. The
          volume’s co-editor Vincent Gillespie, while making the case that Arundel’s successor
          Archbishop Henry Chichele ultimately exercised more lasting influence on the English
          church, concedes that the <hi rend="italic">Constitutions</hi> nevertheless “cast a long
          shadow across the following decades and encourage a sense that the role of the vernacular
          in innovatory religious writing was diminished, and its advocates cowed and anxious.”<note
            target="#91" type="footnotelink">91</note> One institution in which the <hi
            rend="italic">Constitutions</hi>’ influence could be seen immediately was Oxford, which
          the tenth constitution had singled out as “blemished with the new damnable brand of
          Lollardy, to the great scandal of the university itself” — Arundel used the biblical
          imagery of an infected vineyard, sour grapes, and a crumbling wall to describe the
          university’s departure from orthodoxy.<note target="#92" type="footnotelink">92</note> In
          response, Oxford presented its own self-directed program for reform in 1414, which
          included attempts to curb “simony, the appropriation of benefices, exemptions, plurality
          of benefices, the abuse of privileges, clerical apostasy, and the holding of secular
          office.” Gillespie observes the irony that “most of these had been on Wyclif’s own reform
            agenda.”<note target="#93" type="footnotelink">93</note></p>
        <p style="body" n="54">The concerns with clerical and institutional corruption expressed by
          the gloss of the <hi rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi> and echoed by Wyclif and the
          Lollards were clearly not the concerns merely of a heretical group or a minority of
          agitators, but issues that were being discussed, with an eye to reform, within the church
          itself and across a broad swath of the laity. Though the church and the university were
          also clamping down on Lollardy and highly aware of the movement’s dangers in the early
          fifteenth century, particularly its heterodox sacramental theology, the substance of their
          critiques implied that “the calls for reform made by Wyclif himself, particularly in his
          earlier work, remained valid and needed addressing.”<note target="#94" type="footnotelink"
            >94</note></p>
        <p style="body" n="55">Kelly, in an alternate view of Arundel’s censorship and the
          Wycliffite Bible more broadly, speculates that it may not have been Wycliffite Bibles
          themselves that prompted Arundel to hold the convocation that led to the <hi rend="italic"
            >Constitutions</hi>, but specifically the treatise on English translation that appears
          in its General Prologue, which he titles <hi rend="italic">Five and Twenty
            Books</hi>.<note target="#95" type="footnotelink">95</note> Kelly pushes this suggestion
          further into speculation about the church’s tolerance of the translation project that had
          already been accomplished:</p>
        <quote>I suggest that Arundel and his colleagues were familiar with both EV and LV, and,
          recognizing their orthodoxy, believed them to antedate, at least in their inception if not
          completion, the Wycliffite stratagem of making a new translation, and therefore to fall
          outside the mandate to be vetted by bishops. The bishops and clergy were to be on the
          alert for any translations that, unlike EV and LV, distorted the text in ways that would
          promote Wyclif’s malignant teachings.<note target="#96" type="footnotelink"
          >96</note></quote>
        <p style="bodyfirst" n="18">Perhaps the strongest evidence in favor of Kelly’s view is that
          the sixth constitution speaks first of future translations and the need to license them in
          advance, and only afterward makes reference to recent translations. The fourth
          constitution forbids any public or private debate at Oxford on the church’s teachings on
          the sacraments, and the fifth bans the teaching of any “book or treatise composed by John
          Wicklif” without prior examination by a university council,<note target="#97"
            type="footnotelink">97</note> but it is unclear, and in fact seems unlikely, whether the
          already existing Oxford Bible translations would fall in the category of books “composed
          by John Wicklif” — they certainly do not, even upon close scrutiny, belong in the same
          category of sacramental heresy as Wyclif’s treatises which openly state his opposition to
          the doctrine of transubstantiation.</p>
        <p style="body" n="56">There is also little evidence to suggest that owners of Wycliffite
          Bibles were persecuted for that ownership alone. Records of the interrogations of Lollard
          dissidents, such as William Thorpe, Walter Brut, and Hawisia Moone,<note target="#98"
            type="footnotelink">98</note> to the extent that their transcriptions are accurate,
          indicate that while their access to banned materials might have been a concern and the
          material might have been confiscated, Arundel and other church officials were primarily
          interested in their beliefs and their engagement in “sowynge . . . fals doctryne” through
          preaching with these texts, rather than mere ownership.<note target="#99"
            type="footnotelink">99</note> In his personal examination of Thorpe in 1407, for
          example, Arundel lists the heresies the Lollard preacher is accused of spreading — denying
          the sacrament of the altar, opposing pilgrimages, etc. — but the list includes no mention
          of English translation of Scripture.<note target="#100" type="footnotelink">100</note>
          Arundel mentions having confiscated Thorpe’s Psalter — presumably an English translation,
          since Thorpe claims to know no Latin — but says he will return it if Thorpe agrees “fulli
          to be gouerened by holi chirche.”<note target="#101" type="footnotelink">101</note></p>
        <p style="body" n="57">The Oxford call for reforms in 1414 included a section titled “de
          anglicatione librorum” (on the Englishing of books), which called for the confiscation of
          incompetent translations that would mislead the laity, at least until superior
          translations could be produced by Oxford’s scholars. Gillespie notes that this request
          “probably reflected the aspiration in chapter 6 of Arundel’s decrees for a
          university-based system of examination and distribution of such texts through exemplars
          held by university stationers” and that Oxford’s leaders were arguing “only for a deferral
          of translation, not a prohibition of it.”<note target="#102" type="footnotelink"
            >102</note> It also implies that access to English translations of Scripture and other
          religious texts was widespread among the laity and not being vigorously prosecuted, even
          five years after Arundel’s ban.</p>
        <p style="body" n="58">English Bible production also did not completely cease in the years
          following the <hi rend="italic">Constitutions</hi>. If nothing else, the sheer number of
          surviving copies serves as evidence that many people either secured the Archbishop’s
          approval for ownership or were simply tolerated — as noted above, King Henry VI himself
          owned a copy, and Lawton observes that “Wycliffite Bibles were preserved without great

            >103</note> The Carthusian monk Nicholas Love secured Arundel’s approval, and according
          to Love his blessing and encouragement, to produce and distribute his translation of an
          Italian commentary on the Gospels titled <hi rend="italic">The Mirror of the Blessed Life
            of Jesus Christ</hi> in 1410. Love’s expanded commentary included attacks on the
          Lollards, and according to Kantik Ghosh’s assessment of the text, Love hoped his <hi
            rend="italic">Mirror</hi> would become “an official alternative to the Lollard
            Bible.”<note target="#104" type="footnotelink">104</note></p>
        <p style="body" n="59">All the same, the Wycliffite Bible manuscripts of the fifteenth
          century do tend to have a muted appearance, at least in comparison to Bible productions in
          Latin or other languages like the lavishly illuminated French <hi rend="italic">Bibles
            moralisées</hi> or Apocalypse books described above. Illuminated Wycliffite Bibles like
          Bodley MS 277 — King Henry’s Bible — with its decorated borders and gilded initial
          letters, are the rare exception. The Plimpton manuscript is far more typical — a small
          codex containing a New Testament with no illuminations and only small rubricated initials,
          the biblical text embedded within other tracts and sermons so that only a close
          examination would reveal the book’s contents. Whether the book was literal contraband, or
          whether its production was merely pared down in a precautionary way, it is hard to avoid
          the conclusion that the <hi rend="italic">Constitutions</hi>, or at least the threat of
          church sanction, had an adverse effect on the production of Plimpton and other English
          Bibles.</p>
        <p style="heading" n="11">The Gloss and Lollard Anticlericalism</p>
        <p style="bodyfirst" n="19">Though the Wycliffite Bible would come to bear his name in
          popular parlance, the level of John Wyclif’s actual involvement with the Oxford Bible
          translation project is an open question. Dove begins her study of the Wycliffite Bible
          with the speculation “that Wyclif instigated the project, that work began in the early
          1370s, in the Queen’s College, Oxford, and that Wyclif, [Nicholas] Hereford, and [John]
          Trevisa all played a part in the translation.”<note target="#105" type="footnotelink"
            >105</note> David Fowler takes a more cautious view, observing that only two Wycliffite
          Bible manuscripts contain any attributions of authorship at all, to “N,” “J and other
          men,” and “Nicholay de herford,” and he concludes, “The most that can be said from
          manuscript evidence is that the Early Version was made by Nicholas Hereford, J.___, and
          other men.”<note target="#106" type="footnotelink">106</note> The first fourteenth-century
          reference to Wyclif as a translator appears only after his death, in the Augustinian canon
          Henry Knighton’s <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi> (ca. 1390), in the context of warning
          about his dangerous heresies:</p>
        <quote>Master John Wyclif translated from Latin into the English language — very far from
          being the language of angels! — the gospel that Christ gave to the clergy and doctors of
          the church, for them to administer sweetly as mental nourishment to laypeople and to the
          infirm, according to the necessity of the time and the people’s need. As a consequence,
          the gospel has become more common and more open to laymen and even to women who know how
          to read than it customarily is to moderately well-educated clergy of good intelligence.
          Thus the pearl of the gospel is scattered abroad and trodden underfoot by swine.<note
            target="#107" type="footnotelink">107</note></quote>
        <p style="bodyfirst" n="20">Debates between Lollards and church officials over the orthodoxy
          and desirability of English Bible translations would rage in the following years, but
          Knighton’s early response summarizes well the church’s primary objections — the English
          language is less suitable than Latin as a conduit for Scripture, the right and duty to
          convey Scripture to the people and interpret it belongs solely to the clergy, and the
          laity should only access it directly as necessity demands, since they are incapable of
          understanding or rightly using the knowledge it contains. The note of anxiety about
          “laymen and even . . . women” gaining access to the gospel over “moderately well-educated
          clergy” serves as a reminder that the Lollard movement’s leaders, despite their veneration
          of Wyclif and other figures connected to Oxford as their intellectual forebears, were
          themselves much less educated, and their ranks included many women.</p>
        <p style="body" n="60">From the perspective of Wyclif and his Lollard followers, the
          education of the laity through unmediated Scripture was a positive development. As early
          as his treatise <hi rend="italic">De Ecclesia</hi>, which predates the EV by several
          years, Wyclif had presented an anti-papal argument for why every Christian should be
          thoroughly familiar with the Bible. Scripture, he argued, is “the glass by which heretics
          may be discerned,” including the pope, and it is the layman’s duty to determine whether
          the pope’s commands are in accord with Scripture and therefore lawful.<note target="#108"
            type="footnotelink">108</note> Wyclif viewed the primary purpose of biblical education
          among the laity as protection from heresy, especially from “pseudo-disciples” in the
          clergy who would claim direct authority from God,<note target="#109" type="footnotelink"
            >109</note> a view echoed by the Wycliffite Bible’s General Prologue, which claimed it
          was the fear of being caught in simony, heresy, and “manie othere synnes” that motivated
          the clergy’s opposition to English translation.<note target="#110" type="footnotelink"
            >110</note></p>
        <p style="body" n="61">If one of the central motivations of Wycliffite translators was
          suspicion of the corrupted clergy, and a desire to circumvent their monopoly on biblical
          interpretation by making Scripture available to the laity directly, the decision of the
          Plimpton manuscript compilers to use the <hi rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi> and its
          commentary as the concluding text of the New Testament makes perfect sense. As the gloss
          was translated from Anglo-Norman into Middle English, it was revised and expanded with
          additions that amplified its anticlerical critiques. The Lollard producers of the Plimpton
          manuscript made even further changes; unlike the biblical text, which required a high
          level of accuracy and fidelity to the original, the gloss could serve as a platform from
          which they expressed the concerns of their movement. The most prominent of these is the
          critique leveled at “prelates,” a catch-all term for officials of any rank in the church
          hierarchy.</p>
        <p style="body" n="62">As the Explanatory Notes detail, the first reference to “holi
          prelatis” in the gloss (1.¶11) describes their duty to preach and “conseile men after
          Goddis lawe,” the Plimpton manuscript’s revision of the commentary’s original description
          of priests hearing confessions and absolving congregants of sin through the sacrament of
          penance. This curious alteration may reflect a general Lollard suspicion about the
          necessity of sacraments, especially those performed by a priest in mortal sin, and a
          corresponding veneration of preaching and teaching as the most important elements of a
          clerical vocation. Later additions to the gloss unique to Plimpton spell out exactly how a
          priest might fall into the sin that would corrupt his office — the gloss in 13.¶9
          describes “false profetis” and “prelatis that doone her synne of leccherie priveli
          [privately]”; who earn money from “londis” and “rentis” and “symonye,” the selling of
          church offices; who join “the ordre” (whether the priesthood itself or a monastic or
          fraternal order is unclear) so that they can “han bodili delites”; who are “Anticristis
          discipils and his ypocritis and eretikis”; and who, like their leader Antichrist who
          appears as an angel of light on the outside but is a devil on the inside, ultimately
          “disceyven the folk and leden hem to perdicioun.” A later gloss describes clerks and
          prelates as beholden to three of the Seven Deadly Sins, “pride, coveitise [greed], and
          leccherie,” and compares their false preaching to the croaking of foul “froschis [frogs]”
          (16.¶11). In a gloss on the biblical passage in which merchants weep over the destruction
          of Babylon, Plimpton rejects the original gloss’s interpretation of the merchants as
          usurers, a sin that anyone lending money could commit, and instead accuses them of
          “symonyes” (18.¶9), a sin specific to high-ranking clergy, who enrich themselves by
          selling ecclesiastical offices for money.</p>
        <p style="body" n="63">One final example of an anticlerical passage, unique to the English
          translation of the gloss though not to Plimpton, gives a striking glimpse into the
          author’s sense of the priesthood’s absolute corruption:</p>
        <quote>His [the Antichrist’s] profetis been coveitouse men of holi chirche, proude men and
          losengeris [flatterers], men lecchoures. But the losengeris ben worst of alle that maken
          hem [themselves] holi outher [either] for drede outher fore love, outher for ler [loss].
          That thei hopen thei schulden nothing han of hem [their parishioners?] yif thei seiden hem
          the sothe [truth]. These han taken undirhond [in hand] to speke the develis langage to
          disceyven Goddis children and binyme [rob] God his eritage, and which ben strenger and
          werse than any devel in helle. (20.¶3)</quote>
        <p style="bodyfirst" n="21">The precise sense of a few phrases in this passage is obscure,
          and the explanatory note in the text presents a few interpretive possibilities. But its
          overall message is that these proud flatterers and lechers have taken holy orders for all
          the wrong reasons — out of fear or a desire for flattery or material gain — and that they
          tell lies to God’s people knowing that the truth will not earn them as much. The final
          sentence of the passage in particular is crystal clear — the clergy who deceive God’s
          children in this way are worse than any devil in hell.</p>
        <p style="body" n="64">In addition to conveying many of the central concerns of anticlerical
          polemicists in the late fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries, these examples from the
          gloss illustrate another key aspect of the Lollards’ practice of biblical interpretation,
          already mentioned in the section on “Apocalypse Commentaries” above. Like the Franciscans
          and other Apocalypse commentators before them, the Lollards did not view the Book of
          Revelation as merely a set of obscure prophecies about futuristic end times, unrelated to
          their daily concerns. Rather, they believed that it contained a set of teachings with
          direct relevance to their contemporary lives. With the production of translations like the
            <hi rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi>, lay readers could now access biblical texts
          directly, without the potentially corrupt mediation of false teachers those very texts
          warned them against.</p>
        <p style="heading" n="12">Conclusion: Why the Plimpton Manuscript?</p>
        <p style="bodyfirst" n="22">In some respects, using the Plimpton manuscript as the base text
          for a new edition of the <hi rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi> is an unusual choice.
          It is not the oldest extant copy of the text — that distinction likely belongs to British
          Library MS Harley 874 (H), dating from roughly 1340 to 1370, which Fridner used as the
          base text for his 1961 edition and which this edition uses for secondary readings. As
          noted above, none of the early manuscripts that predate the Wycliffite Bible contain
          verses 1:1–8, and many contain other lacunae — H, for instance, is missing what appears to
          be a full leaf, which required Fridner to use a secondary manuscript for that section of
          the text, Cambridge University, Magdalene College MS Pepys 2498 (P). P is a later
          manuscript production, possibly as late as 1400, but its text does not appear to have been
          influenced by Wycliffite material. Another possible candidate for earliest manuscript,
          Cambridge University, Caius College MS 231/117, starts at verse 1:21 and is missing enough
          pages throughout to be considered fragmentary. These gaps are not insurmountable obstacles
          to producing a critical edition, of course, and Fridner is remarkably thorough in
          cataloging manuscript variants, apart from the absence of Plimpton. They illustrate,
          however, that there is no perfectly stable base text, and that any edition of the <hi
            rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi> in its original form — to the extent that an
          original form is possible to access — will be to some degree a patchwork of multiple
          witnesses.</p>
        <p style="body" n="65">Among the later manuscripts of the <hi rend="italic">English
            Apocalypse</hi> which draw on Wycliffite material to create a more complete hybrid text,
          however, Plimpton is a strong candidate for the base text of a critical edition, even
          apart from its unique placement within a blended Wycliffite New Testament. It represents a
          complete version of the <hi rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi>, not in spite of its
          reliance on Wycliffite material but because of it — any potential gaps in its copy text
          are plugged with passages from the Wycliffite LV, and even seemingly minor issues with the
          parent text are occasionally papered over by what appears to be scribal consultation with
          the Wycliffite text. For an example, see the explanatory notes for 5.¶3 and 5.¶4, as well
          as the note above in the section “The Manuscript” about the biblical text’s mistranslation
          of the Anglo-Norman “phioles” (vials) as “fithelis” (fiddles), and its subsequent
          correction in the gloss with apparent assistance from the LV. For a similar scenario in
          reverse, see the explanatory note for 10.¶2, where the biblical text in verse 10:4 follows
          the LV in using “marke” (seal, conceal) while the gloss remains keyed to its Anglo-Norman
          source. Also see the explanatory note for 12.¶2, where Plimpton alone among <hi
            rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi> manuscripts follows the LV in using “aperide”
          (appeared) rather than “shewed,” in a section that may parallel the LV more generally. On
          other occasions, Plimpton offers wholly unique translations — for a compelling and
          somewhat mysterious example, see the explanatory note for Prol.¶2, where an unusual word,
          “asilen” (assail?), appears to serve as both a thematic and visual parallel to the later
          word “arisen” (arise).</p>
        <p style="body" n="66">With all of these emendations in mind, an appropriate alternate title
          for this edition might be <hi rend="italic">The English Apocalypse in Transition</hi>. It
          is not an authoritative text from a single uncorrupted source with an unbroken line of
          transmission, but rather a snapshot of the Apocalypse as it was being produced in England
          at a specific moment in time — an especially intriguing moment, as a popular and
          influential new translation was emerging but simultaneously being suppressed, and as
          scribes and manuscript compilers had access to multiple English translations, which had
          travelled a variety of paths through the languages of Europe, and which they could now fit
          together to form the strongest possible version of the <hi rend="italic">English
            Apocalypse</hi> in their judgment. The text is complete, but it is also contingent,
          neither permanent nor the last word in the Apocalypse’s development in England.</p>
        <p style="body" n="67">As the histories of both French and English Bible translation make
          clear, the concept of a “Bible” as a single, stable volume of divinely inspired texts,
          while it may have been a conceptual ideal, has rarely reflected the practical reality of
          manuscript and book production. From the emergence of the early Christian church to the
          late fourteenth century in England, the experience of most Christian readers with biblical
          texts was most often fragmentary and mediated. Even Wycliffite Bible texts, the most
          standardized biblical productions of their era, frequently appear in manuscripts that
          contain just one or only a few books of the Bible, often alongside paraphrases, Gospel
          harmonies, poems, devotional works, polemics, and/or liturgical aids, to create what Mary
          Raschko calls “an alternative form of New Testament.”<note target="#111"
            type="footnotelink">111</note></p>
        <p style="body" n="68">The Plimpton manuscript as a whole obviously fits squarely in this
          category. But so does Plimpton’s copy of the <hi rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi>
          specifically — an apocalyptic Scripture originally written in Greek and translated to
          Latin, translated again to Anglo-Norman French (with the possible intervention of Old
          French in between), then again to Middle English, revised with the aid of another Middle
          English edition translated directly from the Latin by a group of dissident university
          scholars and newly declared heretics, with a commentary featuring freshly sharpened
          critiques of the institutional church and its clerics, all contained within a potentially
          contraband codex with two more English translations of biblical material, proverbs, a
          prophecy against the friars, sermons, poetry, a lectionary calendar, and a Lollard polemic
          against the papacy. Could there be a text more representative of its time and place, a
          fractured and fractious England at the close of the fourteenth century?</p>
        <p style="heading" n="13">Editorial Practice</p>
        <p style="bodyfirst" n="23">This edition follows the METS practice of silently converting
          all Middle English letters and scribal abbreviations to modern English equivalents, adding
          modern punctuation, and standardizing certain spellings for ease of reading, as detailed
          below.</p>
        <p style="body" n="69">The Middle English letter thorn (<hi rend="italic">þ</hi>) is
          replaced in every case with <hi rend="italic">th</hi>. The yogh (<hi rend="italic">ȝ</hi>)
          is replaced with <hi rend="italic">gh</hi>, <hi rend="italic">y</hi>, <hi rend="italic"
            >g</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">z</hi>, depending on its position in a word and the word’s
          modern English spelling. Words such as <hi rend="italic">ȝeven</hi> (give) and <hi
            rend="italic">aȝen</hi> (again or against) are pronounced with a <hi rend="italic"
            >y</hi> sound and are often rendered in Middle English edited texts as <hi rend="italic"
            >yeven</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ayen</hi>, but this edition standardizes the spelling
          with a <hi rend="italic">g</hi> to more closely resemble modern English equivalents. The
          main texts of the edition replace all Middle English letters, but the textual notes that
          quote the secondary manuscripts retain them.</p>
        <p style="body" n="70">The letter <hi rend="italic">u</hi> is replaced with <hi
            rend="italic">v</hi> when its modern English equivalent does so.</p>
        <p style="body" n="71">Ampersands (<hi rend="italic">&amp;</hi>) are replaced with the word
            <hi rend="italic">and</hi>.</p>
        <p style="body" n="72">Proper names, such as “God,” “Jesus,” “Israel,” “Patmos,” etc. are
          inconsistently capitalized in the manuscripts; this edition capitalizes them in every
          case. Capitalized proper names include the word “Apocalips” when it refers to the title of
          the biblical book, but do not include personal pronouns for God and Jesus, which are left
          in lowercase.</p>
        <p style="body" n="73">Throughout the Apocalypse manuscripts and many other religious texts
          in Middle English, the name for Jesus is often written <hi rend="italic">ihū</hi>, with a
          penstroke called a tilde over the <hi rend="italic">u</hi> to indicate an abbreviated <hi
            rend="italic">es</hi>. This edition changes the initial letter to a capital <hi
            rend="italic">J</hi> and expands the abbreviation: <hi rend="italic">Jhesu</hi>. In
          other places, the manuscripts spell the name <hi rend="italic">jesu</hi> without
          abbreviation, and this edition follows by simply capitalizing the initial letter: <hi
            rend="italic">Jesu</hi>.</p>
        <p style="body" n="74">Scribal abbreviations in the primary and secondary manuscripts,
          including superscript letters to indicate insertions, short and long tildes to indicate
            <hi rend="italic">en</hi> or <hi rend="italic">em</hi>, crossbars below <hi
            rend="italic">p</hi> to indicate <hi rend="italic">per</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
            >pro</hi>, and crossbars across double-<hi rend="italic">l</hi> to indicate a terminal
            <hi rend="italic">e</hi>, are silently expanded. The edition occasionally ignores
          scribal abbreviations for the sake of consistency and readability, if the additional
          letters do not change the meaning of the word. For example, the words <hi rend="italic"
            >erthe</hi> (earth) and <hi rend="italic">prechour</hi> (preacher) occasionally include
          a superscript <hi rend="italic">r</hi> to indicate an insertion, but since the notation is
          applied inconsistently and the additional letters would not change the meaning of the
          word, the edition ignores the notation and standardizes their spelling.</p>
        <p style="body" n="75">Chapter divisions in the Apocalypse are marked in all of the
          manuscripts and follow chapter divisions in the Vulgate, which are mirrored in the
          Vulgate’s modern English translation, the Douay-Rheims version of the Bible. In two
          instances, the openings of Chapters 12 and 13, the chapter divisions are slightly
          different from those in many modern editions of the Bible, and these are explained in the
          Textual Notes. Verse numbers, however, are not marked in the original manuscripts, and for
          these the edition follows the Douay-Rheims. Chapter headings appear in bold at the start
          of each chapter, and verse numbers appear in brackets before each verse.</p>
        <p style="body" n="76">The indented paragraph breaks in this edition do not appear in the
          original manuscripts and are fully editorial decisions. In some cases, the paragraphs
          break to conform with modern dialogue convention — starting a new paragraph for each
          speaker in a dialogue exchange — and in other cases, the breaks are simply thematic
          transitions to enhance readability. Paragraphs also break in the transitions from the
          biblical text to the glossed commentary and back, and each of these sections is marked
          with the heading “Texte” or “Glose,” respectively. The manuscript marks the beginning of
          each section of biblical text (with the exception of chapter beginnings) with the word <hi
            rend="italic">texte</hi> or <hi rend="italic">tixte</hi> in red; this edition
          standardizes the spelling. The manuscript is less consistent about placing the word <hi
            rend="italic">glose</hi> at the start of each glossed section, but this edition silently
          adds the heading for consistency wherever it is missing.</p>
        <p style="body" n="77">Because the <hi rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi> alternates
          between biblical passages and commentary, the edition uses paragraph numbers rather than
          verse numbers in citations. The paragraphs are numbered in bold at the start of each
          indented line, and Textual and Explanatory Notes are keyed to these paragraph numbers —
          for example, a note on chapter 1, paragraph 5, is cited as 1.¶5.</p>
        <p style="body" n="78">Extratextual elements in the manuscript, such as enlarged capital
          letters, rubrication, and marginalia, are not represented visually in the edition but are
          catalogued in the Textual Notes. The edition largely ignores the punctuation that appears
          in the original manuscripts — including slashes, interpuncts or middle dots, and colons —
          and silently replaces it with modern English punctuation — periods, commas, quotation
          marks, paragraph indentation, etc. All punctuation in the text is an editorial decision
          made solely for ease of reading, and any interpretation of the text that relies on that
          punctuation is therefore speculative.</p>
