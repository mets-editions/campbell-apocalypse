        <p>The Middle English Texts Series offers a diverse and representative array of literary
          texts that medieval readers in the present-day British Isles would have encountered
          between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries. It is committed to making available both
          affordable print and open access editions to scholars, teachers, and students of the
          Western Middle Ages. In its digital publications, the series prioritizes a user-friendly
          interface and viewing options, multiple downloadable formats, enhanced searchability and
          filtering, and accessibility to the widest possible range of users.</p>
      </projectDesc>
      <editorialDecl>
        <p>METS takes as its mission the creation of affordable editions that would pass scrutiny
          from the most demanding expert, yet would prove comprehensible, and even enticing, to
          someone who had never read Middle English before. This agenda dictates that METS
          publications offer not a critical edition reflecting all surviving manuscripts, and
          certainly not a diplomatic edition, but a best-text edition, informed by the notes and
          apparatus of earlier editions (where these exist), and by substantive variants from other
          manuscript witnesses. Transcriptions of Middle English texts are lightly modernized to
          ensure a smooth reading experience, while non-English texts preserve both the original
          language and a modern English translation in facing-page format. Each edition offers
          expert assistance with language and lexicon, providing glosses alongside the text(s),
          textual and explanatory notes, elucidation of unfamiliar contexts and traditions, and
          thematic and interpretive possibilities. All editions feature general introductions that
          set the edited text within its own time, place, and traditions, and link it to ancestor,
          congener, and successor materials. All publications contain comprehensive, current
          bibliographies of pertinent scholarship and criticism. House style is adapted from the <hi
            rend="italic">Chicago Manual of Style</hi>.</p>
        <correction>
          <p>This text may include corrections made after the original edition went to press in
            order to correct errors and improve glosses. For a full list of editorial and

      <div type="text">
        <p style="bodyfirst">In February 2020, when the Faculty Development Committee of The King’s
          College, New York City, announced it would award me a sabbatical to work on a manuscript
          edition of the <hi rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi>, none of us knew that the entire
          landscape of higher education was about to change dramatically. Nevertheless, after two
          semesters of teaching online and hybrid courses during the COVID-19 pandemic, I was able
          to take a release from teaching in Spring 2021. I am deeply grateful to the college’s
          faculty and administration for their generosity — this book would not exist without it.
          Thank you in particular to Dr. Matthew Parks, the FDC chair, and the rest of the committee
          members who saw value in the project, and to Provost Mark Hijleh, who gave it final
          approval.</p>
        <p style="body">The late Dr. Russell Peck, General Editor of the Middle English Texts
          Series, was the first to agree to publish this book — I am thankful for his confidence in
          the project and saddened for the METS team who have lost a wonderful colleague. Thank you
          especially to Pamela Yee, Managing Editor, who saw me through several early attempts at
          transcription. She worked patiently to get the formatting right and gave me encouragement
          to finish, even while working on her own PhD dissertation. Associate Editors Alan Lupack
          and Susanna Fein did comprehensive reads of the manuscript after its completion, staff
          editors Eleanor Price and Phillip Zaborny collated my transcriptions against the
          manuscripts, staff editors Daniel Kephart and Phillip Zaborny completed the bibliography
          check, and Steffi Delcourt, James Norris, and other editors formatted the edition in
          publishing software — I am grateful for the whole team’s professionalism and attention to
          detail. Special thanks go as well to the National Endowment of the Humanities (NEH), which
          has funded METS for the duration of its existence.</p>
        <p style="body">The pandemic made working on a manuscript edition particularly challenging,
          as it disrupted my initial plans to visit libraries in the UK and New York City in person.
          Instead, I relied on the generosity of several librarians and professors in both countries
          who sent me photographs of medieval manuscripts so I could view them on my computer.</p>
        <p style="body">Thank you first and foremost to Dr. Emily Runde, Curator of Medieval and
          Renaissance Collections at Columbia University’s Rare Book and Manuscript Library. Though
          I had taken my own photographs of the Plimpton manuscript before the library closed to
          in-person research, she supplied me with crucial additional photos where mine were blurry,
          and even took close-up shots of specific sections of manuscript pages so I could see the
          granular detail of the margins, erasures, insertions, and other features that would
          normally be visible only with a physical inspection. Thank you also to Catherine
          Sutherland, Deputy Librarian at the Pepys Library, Magdalene College, Cambridge
          University, who supplied the images for a supplementary manuscript copy of the <hi
            rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi>.</p>
        <p style="body">A special thanks to Dr. Daniel Sawyer, Fitzjames Research Fellow in Medieval
          English Literature at Merton College, Oxford University, who not only generously provided
          me with photographs from the two manuscripts at the Bodleian Library that I used to
          produce the Wycliffite Apocalypse edition in this book, but who also gave me helpful
          advice about transcription and interpreting scribal abbreviations. Dr. Sawyer has worked
          with the Wycliffite Bible project at Oxford, led by Dr. Elizabeth Solopova, which has
          provided scholars with invaluable information about hundreds of extant Wycliffite Bible
          manuscripts and their production histories. Dr. Anne Hudson, who was also affiliated with
          the project, left behind an immense legacy as the preeminent scholar of Wycliffite and
          Lollard texts when she passed away in December 2021.</p>
        <p style="body">My first experience reading an <hi rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi>
          manuscript was at the British Library’s Manuscripts Reading Room in 2010 while working on
          my PhD dissertation, and the staff there were immensely helpful as I embarked on my first
          research journey as a medievalist. Thank you also to the unnamed staff members who made
          full-color images of MS Harley 874, the oldest extant copy of the <hi rend="italic"
            >English Apocalypse</hi>, freely available to the public through the British Library’s
          website. Librarians at institutions like these around the world provide an exceedingly
          valuable service to scholars and readers of medieval manuscripts and other archival
          materials. Their contributions are often anonymous or overlooked, but their labor makes a
          book like this one, as well as every printed edition of a manuscript text, possible.</p>
        <p style="body">Though he doesn’t know it, Dr. James Morey of Emory University is partly
          responsible for inspiring this project. At a conference called “Transforming Scripture” at
          St. Anne’s College, Oxford University in 2014, Dr. Morey gave a presentation on
          non-Wycliffite Middle English translations of the Bible which included a discussion of the
            <hi rend="italic">English Apocalypse</hi> and the quirks of its various manuscripts, and
          in a conversation afterward, he pointed me to the Plimpton manuscript at Columbia
          University.</p>
        <p style="body">Thank you to my colleagues in the English program at The King’s College, Dr.
          Kelly Lehtonen and Prof. Lynda Kong, and all of the students in the English major — I hope
          we can continue to support each other in more book projects in the future. Thanks also to
          the students who worked as my Faculty Assistants while I completed this project: Elaina
          Bals, Gracie McBride, Ellen Scott, and Mattie Townson.</p>
        <p style="body">Lastly, thank you to my wife Alice and my children Jonah and Maddie, to whom
          this book is dedicated, and to my parents for giving all of us a restful place to work and
          vacation in Nebraska during two pandemic summers. The kids were home at our apartment in
          Brooklyn doing online school for about half of the time during my sabbatical, so they got
          to watch Dad spend many hours poring over old manuscript images and laboring to write. I
          will always cherish those days we all spent together — I love you, and you make everything
          worth it.</p>
